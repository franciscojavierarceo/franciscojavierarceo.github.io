{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Goals for 2021","description":"Sharing some of my goals for 2021","date":"January 9, 2021"},"post":{"content":"\n[I previously wrote about 2020](https://franciscojavierarceo.github.io/post/learning-new-things) and I found that reflecting about the chaos of this past year was rather cathartic for me.\n\nWhile I feel lucky to have endured the pandemic without contracting COVID or suffering job losses, it has been quite isolating. I know that I'm not alone in feeling that and we're all getting through this in our own ways. Regardless, I found that writing my thoughts out loud was helpful, so I suppose I'll continue writing for now.\n\nSince I'm going to try to write more I figured I'd share some of my goals for the new year; so, here are my foolish high-level goals in some unknown order:\n\n1. Be a better husband\n2. Talk less, listen more\n3. Cook more intentionally\n4. Speak more intentionally\n5. Help others more effectively\n6. Write at least 2x per month\n7. Exercise ~5x per week\n\nI hope I'm able to accomplish these. With the exclusion of the last two, these goals aren't particularly measurable (I'll probably find a way to measure them) but I hope to make a good effort. I hope to look back here and attempt to hold myself accountable. Maybe I'll provide an update in June, who knows.\n\nMore specific goals that I have that are much more technical in nature are:\n- Connecting Django Rest Framework (DRF) and React while handling data and localization complexities;\n- Deploying a React Native application to both app stores;\n- Putting in some more hours on Airflow / Cloud Composer;\n- Learning how to train my recommendation models on Kubernetes.\n\nThese will be interesting and I'm making progress on DRF and React but I still have quite a bit of work to do.\n\nHopefully this year will be better, I'm optimistic about it.","excerpt":""},"previousPost":{"slug":"i-love-code","frontmatter":{"title":"I Love Code","description":"Some thoughts on the elegance of code.","date":"January 6, 2021"},"excerpt":"","content":"\nI love code. Plain and simple.\n\nI didn't always though. I started programming at 21 years old during my first masters---I was studying statistics and used code only as a means for running regression models and doing microeconometrics research. I started statistical programming back in 2011 using [STATA](https://www.stata.com/) and [SAS](https://www.sas.com/). They weren't *real* programming languages by a computer scientist's standards but that is technically how I started.\n\nI eventually moved onto to learning [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) when I started working and I found myself often writing Monte Carlo simulations of harmonic regressions, two stage least-squares, and other machine learning/statistical phenomenon.\n\nAnd that's how it started. I began learning [Python](https://www.python.org/) more actively at work and it mostly increased from there. During my second masters I started learning [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) in order to use [Torch](http://torch.ch/), which was used by [facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) before [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) was developed. Then at Goldman I had to learn proprietary tools like Slang. Now I've spent the last year learning much more about [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) and web development in general, and I just couldn't help but reflect and think about how much I actually *enjoy* it.\n\nIt's 2021 now and it's officially beeen a 10 year journey learning how to code (although what can only be argued as chaotically and poorly across different disciplines). Back when I first started I had no idea how anything in a computer worked and I was really, really bad at it. \n\nIt was miserable and I always felt deeply insecure about my code. I feel lucky now that I'm no longer code-shy and I don't struggle as much as I used to. That's not to say I don't have typos or bugs (I do!) but it's more to say that it's much easier these days for me to read through and understand how things are working and how to debug.\n\nBut that took me 10 years and it was a literal headache for most of the time. I'm curious to see what I'll feel in 10 years and what else I'll have learned.\n\nAll that just to show this beautiful piece of code, which is *a* way to write a function which takes as input *n* and yields its [Fibonacci Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).\n\n```python\ndef f(n: int) -> int:\n    assert n>0, 'n > 0'\n    if n < 3:\n        return {1:0, 2:1}[n]\n    return f(n-1) + f(n-2)\n```\n\nWhich simply encodes $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \\forall n > 1$, where $F_1 = F_2 = 1$.\n\nThis code is both brief *and* elegant. That's what I love about it. In 5 little lines so much of human collaboration and information is represented. To think that 5 little lines could do all of that is astounding to me, I genuinely find it beauitful. I guess that's because I just love code."},"nextPost":{"slug":"ordinary-least-squares","frontmatter":{"title":"Ordinary Least Squares","description":"A brief note about the most important equation in all of statistics.","date":"January 14, 2021"},"excerpt":"","content":"\nOne of my favorite authors and historical statisticians [Dr. Stephen Stigler](https://stat.uchicago.edu/people/profile/stephen-m.-stigler/) published a wonderful historical review in 1981 titled [*Gauss and the Invention of Least Squares*](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.aos/1176345451). He argued that the prolific [Carl Freidrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss) discovered [Ordinary Least Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares) (OLS) in 1809 and fundamentally shaped the future of science, business, and society as we know it.\n\nSo, what is OLS and why is it so important?\n\nOLS is often referred to by many things across several different discipilines, some of them are:\n\n- Linear Regression\n- Multivariate Regression\n- The Normal Equations\n- Maximum Likelihood\n- Method of Moments\n- Singular Value Decomposition of $X\\bf{w}-\\bf{y}=U(\\Sigma^T\\bf{w}-U^{T}-\\bf{y})$\n\nBut all of them ultimately reflect the same mathematical expression (in scalar notation):\n\n$y_i = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\beta_i x_i + \\epsilon_i $\n\nWhich yields the famous estimator (i.e., equation) for $\\hat{\\beta_j}$ as\n\n$\\hat{\\beta_j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2 / \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$\n\nOr in matrix notation:\n\n$\\bf \\hat{\\beta} = \\bf (X'X)^{-1} X'Y$.\n\nI find this simple equation to be so extraordinary because of what can be learned from it.\n\nThis single expression is used to estimate models for pharmaceuticals, businesses, movie recommendations, and even decisions about public health. I am constantly amazed at how one little equation could accomplish so much.\n\nTo think Gauss had discovered OLS as a method of calculating the orbits of celestial bodies and that today, over 200 years later, humans would use it to for so much of what we do is astounding.\n\nOver the years statisticians, economists, computer scientists, engineers, and psychometricians have advanced OLS in such profound and unique ways. Some of them have been used to reflect data generated from more non-standard distributions (e.g., a [Weibull distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution)), or to frame the problem to use prior information in a structured way (e.g., through [Bayesian Inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference)), while others have enhanced these equations to learn high-dimensional non-linear relationships (e.g., via (Artificial Neural Networks)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network]). Again, all of these are extended from the extraordinary work of Gauss.\n\nThere's so much that can be written about all of the advancements that have been made in all of these fields and a short blog post simply won't do it justice, but I thought I'd at least share some thoughts about it. Somewhere along the way today I came across something related to important equations and it led me to write this, so I hope you enjoyed it. \n\nI'm such a fan of the history of statistics and mathematics that this piece, while not as structured as I'd like, was very enjoyable to write.\n\nHappy computing!\n\n-Francisco"}},"__N_SSG":true}
