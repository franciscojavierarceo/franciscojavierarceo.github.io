{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Data Science and Fintech","description":"How Data Science Scaled the Fintech Revolution","date":"January 22, 2021"},"post":{"content":"\nI've spent the last 10 years working in data science, mostly in finance and technology (fintech) and it's been really exciting to see how data science, engineering, and the internet has reshaped all aspects of finance.\n\n[Others have written before](https://fintechtoday.substack.com/p/part-1-what-is-fintech-30-anyway) about how fintech has evolved over the last decade and one area that I think is interesting is how data science and analytics has helped fuel that growth.\n\n>So, how ***exactly*** has data science helped scale fintech?\n\nI think data science has scaled fintech in five key areas.\n\n## 1. Operations<a name=\"Operations\"></a>\n\nThe market tends to have a preference for technology companies because of the operational efficiencies that come from technology's scale. Simply put, data scientists help identify data and processes that can be automated to help achieve better operational efficiency.\n\nA concrete fintech example of this is fraud operations. If you're a bank with a credit card product, manually reviewing even 10% of your credit card transactions would be an impossible, and costly, task (it's been [cited](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-bitcoin-wont-displace-visa-or-mastercard-soon-2017-12-15) that Visa and Mastercard process 5,000 transactions per second, which would mean that there are 5000 * 60 * 60 * 24=432,000,000 transactions per day to go through).\n\nSo, in this circumstance data scientists build technology and predictive models to reduce the amount of manual review.\n\n## 2. Marketing<a name=\"Marketing\"></a>\n\nIn fintech, Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is everything. Others have written about [CAC and fintech](https://medium.com/unifimoney/the-no-cac-bank-5e0e577d5473) in greater depth, but suffice it to say it is a challenging and competitive problem.\n\nData scientists focused on marketing try to reduce CAC through a wide variety of strategies.\nSome of them are by tightly monitoring product metrics to see which features yield the best ROI for growth, while other approaches take a broader lense by taking a comprehensive view of your marketing investments and, again, optimize the expected return (e.g., through [Marketing Mix Models](https://blog.hurree.co/blog/marketing-mix-modeling)).\n\nOther marketing focused approaches use [propensity models](https://medium.com/the-official-integrate-ai-blog/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-propensity-modeling-521ab660cb43) to try to maximize customer engagement or acquisition. More concretely, this can involve building a propensity model to convert a customer from an email subscriber to a fully-converted user (e.g., for a lending product or a mobile application), while other propensities may focus on simply getting a customer to re-engage with your product.\n\n## 3. Risk Management<a name=\"Risk-Management\"></a>\n\nThis is where I've spent most of my career and I think it's a really hard problem that most fintechs struggle with in the lending space.\nGenerally speaking, data scientists will build risk models (e.g., for credit risk or fraud risk) to predict the probability of default or some likelihood of delinquency ([more on the difference between them](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062315/what-are-differences-between-delinquency-and-default.asp)).\n\nBuilding good predictive models is hard. Building good *risk* models is **extremely** hard.\n\nThis is less because of a technology or data problem and more because of regulatory checks and balances in place. Making sure that you adhere to [FCRA](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/fair-credit-reporting-act), [ECOA](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title15-chapter41-subchapter4&edition=prelim), and other regulatory oversight is hard on its own, adding statistical analysis into the mix makes it more challenging.\n\nImplementation (i.e., getting an algorithm into production that impacts your customers) of these models is a whole other area of data science and one of the areas I personally find quite fun (maybe I'll write more about this topic later).\n\n## 4. Technology<a name=\"Technology\"></a>\n\nData scientists often work with engineering/technology teams in order to improve the technology stack. This may involve changing an architecture to reduce the latency of certain [microservices](https://microservices.io/) or enhancing the curent stack for a unique problem (cue machine learning and [Airflow DAGs](https://airflow.apache.org)).\nWhile some of this is behind the scenes, it can be some of the most impactful work done by a data scientist in the fintech space because of the broader impact to the core business.\n\n## 5. Product<a name=\"Product\"></a>\n\nData scientists working with product teams are often tasked with the measurement of different experiences within the product and finding out ways to enhance it. That can vary from creating dashboards to monitor the right metrics, to building a recommendation system to curate something specific for a user. \n\nData scientists can fuel product growth, which is why [Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft](https://www.datasciencedegreeprograms.net/lists/five-of-the-largest-companies-that-employ-data-scientists/) and other tech companies hire so many data scientists.\n\nIt's worth noting that I've ignored many of the technology and organizational complexities involved when hiring or building data science teams but only because I wanted to keep this post high-level to introduce some of the applications of data science to fintech. In the future, I'll probably write more technical posts of each one of these to give more concrete examples with code and diagrams (which is what I find fun ðŸ˜Š). \n\nTo summarize, data scientists are useful (particularly in fintech) when there are hard problems and data available to solve them.\n\n*Have some feedback?

He argued that the prolific [Carl Freidrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss) discovered [Ordinary Least Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares) (OLS) in 1809 and fundamentally shaped the future of science, business, and society as we know it.\n\nSo, what is OLS and why is it so important?\n\nOLS is often referred to by many things across several different discipilines, some of them are:\n\n- Linear Regression\n- Multivariate Regression\n- The Normal Equations\n- Maximum Likelihood\n- Method of Moments\n- Singular Value Decomposition of $\\bf{X}\\bf{w}-\\bf{y}=U(\\Sigma'\\bf{w}-U'-\\bf{y})$\n\nBut all of them ultimately reflect the same mathematical expression (in scalar notation):\n\n$$y_i = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\beta_i x_i + \\epsilon_i$$\n\nWhich yields the famous estimator (i.e., equation) for $\\hat{\\beta_j}$ as\n\n$$\\hat{\\beta_j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2 / \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$$\n\nOr in matrix notation:\n\n$$\\bf \\hat{\\beta} = \\bf (X'X)^{-1} X'Y$$.\n\nI find this simple equation to be so extraordinary.\n\nWhy? Because of what can be learned from it: the equation basically says \"Look at data about $\\bf{x}$ and estimate a linear relationship to $\\bf{y}$\". \n\nAs a concrete example, imagine you wanted to know the relationship between age and income (a simplification of the well-studied [Mincer Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincer_earnings_function)), how would you figure this out? A simple linear regression could estimate that relationship and the $\\hat{\\beta}$ would represent the partial-correlation (sometimes called the marginal effect or coefficient estimate) and it exactly represents the slope of the line below.\n\n![A scatter plot!](scatterplot.png)\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"padding:0\"><i>A Scatter Plot of Age and Income</i></p>\n\nIsn't that just amazing??\n\nThis single expression is used to estimate models for movie recommendations, businesses, pharmaceuticals, and even decisions about public health. I am constantly amazed at how one little equation could accomplish so much.\n\nTo think Gauss had discovered OLS as a method of calculating the orbits of celestial bodies and that today, over 200 years later, humans would use it to for so much of what we do is astounding.\n\nOver the years statisticians, economists, computer scientists, engineers, and psychometricians have advanced OLS in such profound and unique ways. Some of them have been used to reflect data generated from more non-standard distributions (e.g., a [Weibull distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution)), or to frame the problem to use prior information in a structured way (e.g., through [Bayesian Inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference)), while others have enhanced these equations to learn high-dimensional non-linear relationships (e.g., via [Artificial Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)). Again, all of these are extended from the extraordinary work of Gauss.\n\nThere's so much that can be written about all of the advancements that have been made in all of these fields and a short blog post simply won't do it justice, but I thought I'd at least share some thoughts about it.\n\nSomewhere along the way today I came across something related to important equations and it led me to write this, so I hope you enjoyed it. \n\nI'm such a fan of the history of statistics and mathematics that this piece, while not as structured as I'd like, was very enjoyable to write.\n\nHappy computing!\n\n-Francisco"},"nextPost":{"slug":"how-to-build-a-credit-risk-model","frontmatter":{"title":"How to build a credit risk model","description":"A data scientists guide to building a basic credit risk model","date":"January 27, 2021"},"excerpt":"","content":"\n\n*TL;DR: A Data Science Tutorial on building a Credit Risk model*\n\nI previously [wrote](/post/data-science-and-fintech) about some of the work data scientists do in the fintech space, which briefly discussed [credit risk models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_risk) but I wanted to write a more technical review and talk about what I think are the most important points.\n\nI spent most of my career at banks as a data scientist and built credit risk models in the consumer and commercial space in the US, Australia, and South Africa. I learned a lot from those experiences, so I thought I'd share a simple example of how one of the core pieces of algorithmic/quantitative underwriting is done.\n\nIn this post, I'll try to answer the following questions:\n\n- What is a credit risk model?\n- What **data** does a credit risk model use?\n- How do you estimate a credit risk model?\n- How do you know if your model is performing well?\n- What are some common mistakes to avoid?\n- What are useful facts to know about credit risk models?\n\n## What is a Credit Risk Model?\n\nIn the consumer/retail space, a credit risk model tries to predict the probability that a consumer won't repay money that they've borrowed.\nA simple example of this is an [unsecured personal loan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredloan.asp). \nLet's suppose you submitted an application to borrow $5,000 from a lender. That lender would want to know the likelihood of [default](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) before deciding on (1) whether to give you the loan and (2) the price they want to charge you to for borrowing the money. So that probability is probably quite important...but how do they come up with it?\n\n## Data\n\nLenders typically use data from the major [Credit Bureaus](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/top-three-credit-bureaus/) that is [FCRA](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/fair-credit-reporting-act) compliant, which basically means that the legal and reputational risk of using this data is very low.\n\nTypically, you'd purchase a dataset from one of the bureaus (or use their analytical sandboxes) and process a dataset that looks like the following:\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Default</th>\n    <th>Inquiries in Last 6 Months</th>\n    <th>Credit Utilization</th>\n    <th>Average Age of Credit</th>\n    <th>...</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Yes</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>0.8</td>\n    <td>12</td>\n    <td>...</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>No</td>\n    <td>8</td>\n    <td>0.0</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>...</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>...</td>\n    <td>...</td>\n    <td>...</td>\n    <td>...</td>\n    <td>...</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn summary, it's just a bunch of data about your borrowing history.\nIt's a little recursive/cyclical because in order to grow your credit you need to have credit but let's ignore that detail.\n\nOne of the most important steps in the model development process is defining default because this will eventually reflect the performance of your portfolio, so defining it rigorously, accurately, and confidently is extremely consequential.\n\nSo how do you define it? \n\n\n\n## Estimating the Probability of Default\n\n## Evaluating your Default Model\n- AUC and GINI\n\n## Common Mistakes and Pitfalls\n- Simpson's Paradox\n\n## Other Important pieces\n- Panel Data and the Discrete-Time Hazard Model\n- Generating Adverse Actions codes has a variety of different approaches\n- Does a more complicated model impact my target population?\n\n## Conclusion\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
