I know that I'm not alone in feeling that and we're all getting through this in our own ways. Regardless, I found that writing my thoughts out loud was helpful, so I suppose I'll continue writing for now.\n\nSince I'm going to try to write more I figured I'd share some of my goals for the new year; so, here are my foolish high-level goals in some unknown order:\n\n1. Be a better husband\n2. Talk less, listen more\n3. Cook more intentionally\n4. Speak more intentionally\n5. Help others more effectively\n6. Write at least 2x per month\n7. Exercise ~5x per week\n\nI hope I'm able to accomplish these. With the exclusion of the last two, these goals aren't particularly measurable (I'll probably find a way to measure them) but I hope to make a good effort. I hope to look back here and attempt to hold myself accountable. Maybe I'll provide an update in June, who knows.\n\nMore specific goals that I have that are much more technical in nature are:\n- Connecting Django Rest Framework (DRF) and React while handling data and localization complexities;\n- Deploying a React Native application to both app stores;\n- Putting in some more hours on Airflow / Cloud Composer;\n- Learning how to train my recommendation models on Kubernetes.\n\nThese will be interesting and I'm making progress on DRF and React but I still have quite a bit of work to do.\n\nHopefully this year will be better, I'm optimistic about it."},"nextPost":{"slug":"data-science-and-fintech","frontmatter":{"title":"Data Science and Fintech","description":"How Data Science Scaled the Fintech Revolution","date":"January 22, 2021"},"excerpt":"","content":"\nI've spent the last 10 years working in data science, mostly in finance and technology (fintech) and it's been really exciting to see how data science, engineering, and the internet has reshaped all aspects of finance.\n\n[Others have written before](https://fintechtoday.substack.com/p/part-1-what-is-fintech-30-anyway) about how fintech has evolved over the last decade and one area that I think is interesting is how data science and analytics has helped fuel that growth.\n\n\u003eSo, how ***exactly*** has data science helped scale fintech?\n\nI think data science has scaled fintech in five key areas.\n\n## 1. Operations\u003ca name=\"Operations\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe market tends to have a preference for technology companies because of the operational efficiencies that come from technology's scale. Simply put, data scientists help identify data and processes that can be automated to help achieve better operational efficiency.\n\nA concrete fintech example of this is fraud operations. If you're a bank with a credit card product, manually reviewing even 10% of your credit card transactions would be an impossible, and costly, task (it's been [cited](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-bitcoin-wont-displace-visa-or-mastercard-soon-2017-12-15) that Visa and Mastercard process 5,000 transactions per second, which would mean that there are 5000 * 60 * 60 * 24=432,000,000 transactions per day to go through).\n\nSo, in this circumstance data scientists build technology and predictive models to reduce the amount of manual review.\n\n## 2. Marketing\u003ca name=\"Marketing\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIn fintech, Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is everything. Others have written about [CAC and fintech](https://medium.com/unifimoney/the-no-cac-bank-5e0e577d5473) in greater depth, but suffice it to say it is a challenging and competitive problem.\n\nData scientists focused on marketing try to reduce CAC through a wide variety of strategies.\nSome of them are by tightly monitoring product metrics to see which features yield the best ROI for growth, while other approaches take a broader lense by taking a comprehensive view of your marketing investments and, again, optimize the expected return (e.g., through [Marketing Mix Models](https://blog.hurree.co/blog/marketing-mix-modeling)).\n\nOther marketing focused approaches use [propensity models](https://medium.com/the-official-integrate-ai-blog/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-propensity-modeling-521ab660cb43) to try to maximize customer engagement or acquisition. More concretely, this can involve building a propensity model to convert a customer from an email subscriber to a fully-converted user (e.g., for a lending product or a mobile application), while other propensities may focus on simply getting a customer to re-engage with your product.\n\n## 3. Risk Management\u003ca name=\"Risk-Management\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThis is where I've spent most of my career and I think it's a really hard problem that most fintechs struggle with in the lending space.\nGenerally speaking, data scientists will build risk models (e.g., for credit risk or fraud risk) to predict the probability of default or some likelihood of delinquency ([more on the difference between them](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062315/what-are-differences-between-delinquency-and-default.asp)).\n\nBuilding good predictive models is hard. Building good *risk* models is **extremely** hard.\n\nThis is less because of a technology or data problem and more because of regulatory checks and balances in place. Making sure that you adhere to [FCRA](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/fair-credit-reporting-act), [ECOA](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title15-chapter41-subchapter4\u0026edition=prelim), and other regulatory oversight is hard on its own, adding statistical analysis into the mix makes it more challenging.\n\nImplementation (i.e., getting an algorithm into production that impacts your customers) of these models is a whole other area of data science and one of the areas I personally find quite fun (maybe I'll write more about this topic later).\n\n## 4. Technology\u003ca name=\"Technology\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nData scientists often work with engineering/technology teams in order to improve the technology stack. This may involve changing an architecture to reduce the latency of certain [microservices](https://microservices.io/) or enhancing the curent stack for a unique problem (cue machine learning and [Airflow DAGs](https://airflow.apache.org)).\nWhile some of this is behind the scenes, it can be some of the most impactful work done by a data scientist in the fintech space because of the broader impact to the core business.\n\n## 5. Product\u003ca name=\"Product\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nData scientists working with product teams are often tasked with the measurement of different experiences within the product and finding out ways to enhance it. That can vary from creating dashboards to monitor the right metrics, to building a recommendation system to curate something specific for a user. \n\nData scientists can fuel product growth, which is why [Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft](https://www.datasciencedegreeprograms.net/lists/five-of-the-largest-companies-that-employ-data-scientists/) and other tech companies hire so many data scientists.\n\nIt's worth noting that I've ignored many of the technology and organizational complexities involved when hiring or building data science teams but only because I wanted to keep this post high-level to introduce some of the applications of data science to fintech. In the future, I'll probably write more technical posts of each one of these to give more concrete examples with code and diagrams (which is what I find fun 😊). \n\nTo summarize, data scientists are useful (particularly in fintech) when there are hard problems and data available to solve them.\n\n*Have some feedback?
