Be a better husband\n2. Talk less, listen more\n3. Cook more intentionally\n4. Speak more intentionally\n5. Help others more effectively\n6. Write at least 2x per month\n7. Exercise ~5x per week\n```\n\nI tried to improve on all of these items over the past year (some significantly more than others), but I'm not where I wanted to be on them.\n\nRegardless, I will say I learned a lot more this year by explicitly trying to improve these things. The goals I found most challengine were (1), (2), (5), and (6). I imagine this is because (1) is hard in general, (2) requires constant mental restraint from speaking up when I want to interject with a response or a thought, (5) doesn't truly realize its effectiveness in short time horizons, and (6) was simply not a priority.\n\nI'm mostly okay with the realities of this except (6), since writing requires being more intentional about my time and thoughts, which disappoints me as it suggests I was more chaotic than I wanted to be. As I grow older I realize how much more important it is to be increasingly more deliberate with the allocation of my time but I always struggle with choosing things as I really do enjoy working on and learning new things.\n\nAnyways, here's to hoping I'm more thoughtful with my time over the next couple of months and years.\n\nCheers,\nFrancisco"},"nextPost":null},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/post/[slug]","query":{"slug":"2021-reflection"},"buildId":"QsE2BbWIpz7_7ir0aT9N1","nextExport":false,"isFallback":false,"gsp":true}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-fa276ba060a4a8ac7eef.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-39418da170c6bb422e22.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-e067438c4cf4ef2ef178.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.9707fddd9ae5927c17c3.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.a6f6c255f30e2cc8ab2c.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-72e32743ab51d626031e.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/5e7de4f36e438e169c5d145e7df90137ae956f1e.c55db21543619f2e3353.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/post/%5Bslug%5D-e91e68f836997e8a676e.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/QsE2BbWIpz7_7ir0aT9N1/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/QsE2BbWIpz7_7ir0aT9N1/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
