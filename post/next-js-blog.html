Fortunately, along the way I was able to learn some new things. More specifically, I spent a lot of my time learning how to develop web applications (particularly in \u003ca href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\"\u003eDjango\u003c/a\u003e), which included:\n\n- Building a Content Management System (\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\"\u003eCMS\u003c/a\u003e)\n- Image optimization and various forms of cacheing\n- User authentication and security best practices (e.g., two factor authentication)\n- Developing APIs using Django Rest Framework\n- The benefits of JavaScript code compression/minification\n- How to adhere to SEO best practices for web content\n- Building Webhooks for 3rd party APIs\n- Building an application that handles multiple languages in a database, as an API, and that optimizes for SEO\n\nIt has been an interesting exercise to be much more hands on with JavaScript this past year, especially since my expertise is mainly in Python. As a data scientist, it's interesting to learn how the web is developed and how data is created from the web.\n\nIn statistics, the Data Generating Process (\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_generating_process\"\u003eDGP\u003c/a\u003e) is an extremely critical part of approximating the world with mathematical functions. So, I wanted to learn very rigorously how the web is developed so that I could better understand the DGP and ultimately better approximate the things I'm particularly interested in.\n\nAs an entrepreneur this is a *terrible* way to allocate one's attention in order to accomplish one's business goals, but the knowledge I've gained over the year has been *extremely* valuable and it compounds significantly. I think the knowledge investment I've made this past year has better helped me prepare for much faster growth going forward.\n\nWhat I've learned over the past 10 years is that investing in learning has exponential rewards, especially in time. Things that used to take me days or hours to accomplish can now be solved in minutes.\n\nSo, while my business didn't thrive this year, I do think I have learned a significant amount of information and that's invaluable.\n\nHere's to hoping 2021 is more balanced on learning and execution. I'll try to write a little more frequently about some of the things I'm learning, so I hope you find it interesting."},"nextPost":{"slug":"github-actions","frontmatter":{"title":"Deploying a Next.js Site using Github Actions","description":"GitHub Actions to Deploy a Static Site built with Next.js","date":"January 3, 2021"},"excerpt":"","content":"\nI'm a huge fan of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). They're so simple but so effective at doing such a broad range of things. In short, you can tell GitHub do something on a computer everytime you push to your repository (or to a branch on a specific repository like the `main` branch).\n\nFor today's post, I'll focus on how I used an action to automate deploying my static site built with Next.js to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).\n\nI made this blog on a repository hosted on GitHub and added a GirHub Action to compile the JavaScript/React code into static HTML files. This really didn't require all that much effort.\n\n\nHere's what I had to do:\n\n1. Build a Next.js blog following the [detailed tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) and store the code on a GitHub repository\n2. Create a workflow file in the repository with the following path: [**./github/workflows/integrate.yml**](https://github.com/franciscojavierarceo/franciscojavierarceo.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/integrate.yml)\n3. Specify that workflow file to export the static files whenever I push to **main** and *commit* the exported files to a separate branch called **gh-pages** (you can just follow the workflow file I used)\n4. Manually add a **.nojekyll** file to the **gh-pages** branch (this is to resolve [this bug](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/2029))\n5. Configure my repository Settings so that it sources the GitHub Pages build from the **gh-pages** branch\n\nAnd that's it, adding new blog posts is as simple as creating a new [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) file and pushing to the **main** branch. The GitHub Action will handle all of the rest!\n\nThis is much nicer in behavior than my old site, which was built using Jekyll (a Ruby framework) and it's much less work than building a full application with Django to get high quality page loads. I’d add that I’m a huge fan of Django but I think for a static, fast, and lightweight site, Next.js my new go to!"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/post/[slug]","query":{"slug":"next-js-blog"},"buildId":"StXy9NxX_B9NgB53170ra","nextExport":false,"isFallback":false,"gsp":true}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-11c8eba6a84e3fddec04.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-5e6c3476de92ad52e365.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-e067438c4cf4ef2ef178.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.9707fddd9ae5927c17c3.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.a6f6c255f30e2cc8ab2c.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-70282f45e8e07c272795.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/1173eff4538ab0eae4f3f506dea9a7965770ad37.c28e6300b1d6b455d43d.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/post/%5Bslug%5D-26f5f06f8fc249df3b32.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/StXy9NxX_B9NgB53170ra/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/StXy9NxX_B9NgB53170ra/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
