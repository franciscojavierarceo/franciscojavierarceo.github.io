One of the main reasons I was particularly interested in Next.JS was because of it's opinionated optimizations.\n\nIn my last post I mentioned that I spent a lot of time learning about the technical details of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and trying to optimize my Django application for that. I was ultimately reasonably successful in it but much of the logic to do so was tedious to author and rather unpleasant, which is why I'm excited about Next.JS, since it automates much of this for you right out of the box.\n\nTo learn it, I built this blog using their \u003ca href=\"https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app\"\u003etutorial\u003c/a\u003e, which I highly recommend!\n\nMy goal is to move \u003ca href=\"https://www.unidosfin.com/en\"\u003eUnidos\u003c/a\u003e to Next.JS for the front-end and keep the Django back-end, much of which I've already converted to APIs."}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/post/[slug]","query":{"slug":"learning-new-things"},"buildId":"VvXy6JzsKxnaueCkMsBbV","nextExport":false,"isFallback":false,"gsp":true}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-fa276ba060a4a8ac7eef.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-39418da170c6bb422e22.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-e067438c4cf4ef2ef178.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.9707fddd9ae5927c17c3.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.a6f6c255f30e2cc8ab2c.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-fc721cbdbe39030f9588.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/5e7de4f36e438e169c5d145e7df90137ae956f1e.c55db21543619f2e3353.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/post/%5Bslug%5D-e91e68f836997e8a676e.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/VvXy6JzsKxnaueCkMsBbV/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/VvXy6JzsKxnaueCkMsBbV/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
