  My personal site using Next.js
</h1>

I built this site using Next.js's tutorial <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup">here</a> based on a template provided by [@jfelix](https://github.com/JoseRFelix) and modified it to use Github Actions to deploy it to Github Pages.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Note this is build using node version 12.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## ‚úç Customizing Tailwind Typography

[Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) is an official tailwind plugin that provides a set of `prose` classes to add beautiful typographic defaults to any vanilla HTML you don't control (like HTML rendered from Markdown, or pulled from a CMS).

To customize the defaults provided by the plugin, add the overrides under the `typography` key in the theme section of the `tailwind.config.js` file. Refer to its [default styles](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography/blob/master/src/styles.js) for more in-depth examples.

For more information, please check out Tailwind Typography's [customization section](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography#customization).
