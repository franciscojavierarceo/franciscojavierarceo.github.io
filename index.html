I learned a lot from those experiences, so I thought I'd share a simple example of how one of the core pieces of algorithmic/quantitative underwriting is done.\n\nIn this post, I'll try to answer the following questions:\n\n- What is a credit risk model?\n- What **data** does a credit risk model use?\n- How do you estimate a credit risk model?\n- How do you know if your model is performing well?\n- What are some common mistakes to avoid?\n- What are useful facts to know about credit risk models?\n\nSo let's dive right in.\n\n## What is a Credit Risk Model?\n\nIn the consumer/retail space, a credit risk model tries to predict the probability that a consumer won't repay money that they've borrowed.\nA simple example of this is an [unsecured personal loan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredloan.asp). \n\nLet's suppose you submitted an application to borrow $5,000 from a lender. That lender would want to know the likelihood of [default](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) before deciding on (1) whether to give you the loan and (2) the price they want to charge you for borrowing the money. So that probability is probably quite important...but how do they come up with it?\n\n## What Data does a Credit Risk Model Use?\n\nLenders typically use data from the major [Credit Bureaus](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/top-three-credit-bureaus/) that is [FCRA](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/fair-credit-reporting-act) compliant, which basically means that the legal and reputational risk of using this data is very low.\n\nTypically, you'd purchase a dataset from one of the bureaus (or use data inside one of their analytical sandboxes) and clean the dataset into something that looks like the following:\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003eDefault\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003eInquiries in Last 6 Months\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003eCredit Utilization\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003eAverage Age of Credit\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003e...\u003c/th\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003eYes\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e2\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e0.8\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e12\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003eNo\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e8\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e0.0\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e2\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn summary, it's just a bunch of data about your borrowing history.\nIt's a little recursive/cyclical because in order to grow your credit you need to have credit but let's ignore that detail.\n\nOne of the most important steps in the model development process is *precisely* defining **default** because this will eventually reflect the performance of your portfolio defining it thoughtfully, accurately, and confidently is extremely consequential.\n\nSo how do you define it?\n\nTime. \n\nIf you're planning to launch a term loan, you usually set boundaries on the duration of the loan. For revolving lines of credit (like a credit card), you simply apply a reasonable boundary on time that makes good business sense.\n\nLet's say you want to launch a 12 month loan to an underserved market, then you'd want to get historical data of other lenders to build your model on.\nIt sounds a little surprising that you can do this but that's basically how the bureaus make their money.\n\nAn important thing to keep in mind is that you need to make sure you pull the data at 2 different time periods: (1) when the original application was made so you can use data that is relevant for underwriting (and so you don't have forward-looking data resulting in [data leakage](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/data-leakage)) and (2) 12 months later (or whatever time period is appopriate for you) to check if the consumer defaulted on their loan.\n\nThere's a lot more to it and you can expand on things in much more elegant ways to handle different phenomena but for the sake of simplicity, this is essentially how it's done.\n\nSo, after painfully cleaning up all that data, what do you do with it?\n\n## Building a Probability of Default Model\n\nNow that you have that glorious dataset you can start to run different [Logistic Regressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) or use other classification based [machine learning](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/08/10-algorithms-machine-learning-engineers.html) algorithms to find hidden patterns and relationships (i.e., [non-linear functions](https://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/what-is-the-difference-between-linear-and-nonlinear-equations-in-regression-analysis#:~:text=If%20the%20equation%20doesn't,a%20linear%20equation%2C%20it's%20nonlinear.\u0026text=Thetas%20represent%20the%20parameters%20and,one%20parameter%20per%20predictor%20variable.) and [interaction terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics))).\n\nPersonally, this is the most intellectually engaging part of the work. The other work involved in credit risk modeling is usually very stressful and filled with less exciting graphs but here you get to pause, look at data, and, for a moment, try to make a crude approximation of the world. I find this part *fascinating*.\n\nIf we stick with our simple dataset above for our model, we could use our good old friend Python to run that Logistic Regression.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n# Generating the data \nn = 10000\nnp.random.seed(0)\nx_1 = np.random.poisson(lam=5, size=n)\nx_2 = np.random.poisson(lam=2, size=n)\nx_3 = np.random.poisson(lam=12, size=n)\ne = np.random.normal(size=n, loc=0, scale=1.)\n\n# Setting the coefficient values to give us a ~5% default rate\nb_1, b_2, b_3 = -0.005, -0.03, -0.15\nylogpred =  x_1 * b_1 + x_2 * b_2 + x_3 * b_3 + e\nyprob = 1./ (1.+ np.exp(-ylogpred))\nyclass = np.where(yprob \u003e= 0.5, 1, 0)\nxs = np.hstack([\n    x_1.reshape(n, 1), \n    x_2.reshape(n, 1), \n    x_3.reshape(n, 1)\n])\n# Adding an intercept to the matrix\nxs = sm.add_constant(xs)\nmodel = sm.Logit(yclass, xs)\n# All that work just to run .fit(), how terribly uninteresting\nres = model.fit()\nprint(res.summary())\n\n         Current function value: 0.163863\n         Iterations 8\n                           Logit Regression Results                           \n==============================================================================\nDep.

This chart may look fancy but it's actually pretty simple, it's just [deciling](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decile.asp) (i.e., sorting and bucketing into 10 equal groups) your data according to the *predicted* default rate from your model. It's worth noting that this is a quantized and reversed version of the [ROC chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) and they represent the same information.\n\nHere's the code to generate that graph.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\ndef liftchart(df: pd.DataFrame, actual: str, predicted: str, buckets: int=10) -\u003e None:\n    # Bucketing the predictions (Deciling is the default)\n    df['predbucket'] = pd.qcut(x=df[predicted], q=buckets)\n    sdf = df[[actual, predicted, 'predbucket']].groupby(\n        by=['predbucket']).agg({\n        actual: [np.mean, sum, len], \n        predicted: np.mean\n        }\n    )\n    sdf.columns = sdf.columns.map(''.join) # I hate pandas multi-indexing\n    sdf = sdf.rename({\n        actual + 'mean': 'Actual Default Rate', \n        predicted + 'mean': 'Predicted Default Rate'\n    }, axis=1)\n    sdf[['Actual Default Rate', 'Predicted Default Rate']].plot(\n        kind='line', style='.-', grid=True, figsize=(12, 8), \n        color=['red', 'blue']\n    )\n    plt.ylabel('Default Rate')\n    plt.xlabel('Decile Value of Predicted Default')\n    plt.title('Actual vs Predicted Default Rate sorted by Predicted Decile')\n    plt.xticks(\n        np.arange(sdf.shape[0]), \n        sdf['Predicted Default Rate'].round(3)\n    )\n    plt.show()\n\n# Using the data and model from before!\npdf = pd.DataFrame(xs, columns=['intercept', 'x1', 'x2', 'x3'])\npdf['preds'] = res.predict(xs)\npdf['actual'] = yclass\n\n# Finally, what we all came here to see\nliftchart(pdf, 'actual', 'preds')\n```\n\u003ccenter\u003e\u003ci\u003eJudge me not by the elegance of my code but by the fact that it runs.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\n\n## Evaluating your Default Model\n\nSo this visualization is helpful, but how do you quantify the performance into a single number? Well, how about [Accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision)?\n\nIt turns out that Accuracy isn't really a great metric when you have a low default rate (or more generally when you have severe [class imbalance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_paradox)). As an example suppose you have a 5% default rate, that means 95% of your data did *not default*, so if your model predicted that no one defaulted, you'd have 95% accuracy.\n\nAccurate, obvious, and entirely useless. Without proper adjustment, this behavior is actually very likely to occur in your model, so we tend to ignore the accuracy metric and instead we focus on the rank order seperation/predictive power of the model.\n\nTo measure that predictive power, there are 4 metrics industry professionals typically look at to summarize their model: [Precision, Recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall), the [Kolomogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov_test), and [Gini/AUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve).\n\nOne point of humor that has been a surprisingly common topic of discussion in my career is the equivalence of Gini and AUC. Bankers like Gini, for whatever inertia related reason, but it's equivalent to AUC via:\n\n$$Gini = 2 * AUC - 1$$ \n\nand obviously\n\n$$AUC = \\frac{Gini+1}{2}$$.\n\nGini is bound between [-1, 1] and AUC between [0, 1] but technically if your AUC is less than 0.5 (and \u003c 0 for Gini) that means you're doing worse than random ([and you could do better by literally doing the opposite of what your model says](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/266387/can-auc-roc-be-between-0-0-5)) so most people will say AUC is between 0.5 and 1 and that Gini is between [0, 1].\n\nA good model is usually around 70% AUC / 40% Gini. The higher the better.\n\nIt's always useful to look at your lift chart as it can tell you a lot about how predictive the model is at different deciles. In some cases, your model may not have enough variation in the attributes/features/predictors to differentiate your data meaningfully. The metric won't show you that, only a glance at the lift chart will, so it's always a good to review it.\n\nOne important point here is that any single metric is very crude and a data set can be pathologically constructed to break it, so while these metrics and charts are very helpful, there are cases where things can still misbehave even though they seem normal.\n\nNow that you have your exciting new default model, you can use it in your underwriting strategy to differentiate amongst your competitors on pricing, approve/decline, and targeting customers, right?\n\nNot quite.\n\n## Common Mistakes and Pitfalls\n\nBefore you get too excited about your model, you want to verify that it's behaving logically, so I thought I'd list some items that you will want to check against to make sure nothing disastrous will happen. \n\n- Double check for [Data Leakage](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/data-leakage)\n- Verify that you don't have any [data errors](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/common-errors-in-machine-learning-due-to-poor-statistics-knowledg)\n- Make sure you've done your best not to fall for [Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox)\n- Validate your model with an [Out of Time](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/22/30560/) Hold Out Sample\n- Confirm your model actually has a [representative sample](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/representative-sample.asp#:~:text=A%20representative%20sample%20is%20a,three%20males%20and%20three%20females.) of your future portfolio\n- Make sure you're not time traveling \n    - There's no external resource for this but it's basically making sure you don't use data that's in the future of what you're representing (except the default flags that you're trying to predict/model)\n- Understand the correlation this default prediction may have to your other products in your portfolio\n    - This is not important from a statistical perspective but it is very important for your business\n\nI could have written a book with a much longer set of information both from a statistical and business lense but, for the sake of brevity, I wrote the most pressing ones and I invite you to search for more information about other important details.\n\n[Here's a book recommendation on credit risk modeling.](https://www.amazon.com/Credit-Risk-Modelling-Theoretical-Foundations-Diagnostic-ebook/dp/B07FZGG63V)\n\n## Some other Interesting Extensions\n\n\n### Model Extensions\nThe model I showed above is quite literally the most basic example and the models that most lenders and vendors use are much, much more sophisticated. Many of them have enhanced their models to handle [panel data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel_data) (i.e., cohorts of people over time) and can construct models that are extremely robust.\n\nThe best class of models in this elite category (in my personal opinion) are [Discrete Time Survival Models](https://bookdown.org/content/4253/fitting-basic-discrete-time-hazard-models.html). Actually, this isn't *my* opinon, this wisdom was shared with me from two of the former heads of statistical modeling at Capital One, so don't trust my judgement, trust theirs.\n\n### Quantization and the Weight of Evidence\nAnother interesting implementation detail is that statisticians/data scientists in the credit scoring space often transform the inputs/attributes/features of their model via [quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization). More specifically through a transformation called the [Weight of Evidence](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/08/13/weight-of-evidence/). It's neat, troglodytic, and surprisingly effective.\n\n\n### Adverse Action Reasons\nCredit risk modeling requires the underwriter to grant adverse action codes in the case of rejecting a customer who applies for a credit product (this is a driven by the FCRA). Doing this algorithmitically is very doable and different organizations do it slightly differently but the short version is you take the absolute largest partial predictions (i.e., $argmax_{x}f(x_j) = |x_j * \\beta_j|$,  $\\forall j=1,..., k$).\n\n### Model Complexity and Usefulness\nLastly, when building these statistical models the most important thing to think about is the trade-off between complexity and performance on your target population. Typically in the lending space you will not approve all of your customers, so obsessing over model fit on the proportion of your population that won't be approved is not always useful. It's a small point, but extremely consequential and will hopefully save you some time.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis tutorial was not nearly as code heavy as I would have liked (only showing a very silly regression) but I felt like the content was still rather dense. \n\nPeople spend their careers studying these statistical models and the important consequences of them, so I really want to emphasize how much I have trivialized the work here only for the sake of simplicity. I have not talked about how you can improve the model when it's underperforming or how one can try to measure biases that may occur, but these are important pieces for society.\n\nI will conclude by saying that these models are tightly modeled and governed by many layers of regulation. As a statistician and a minority, I think this is a good thing. \nThat's not to say that harm isn't caused by these models because I think there is but I do think machines are more easily governed, evaluated, and modified...unlike human decision making which can be subjective and prone to unknown biases that are difficult to quantify.\n\nI hope you found this post useful and interesting.\n\n*Have some feedback?

Operations\u003ca name=\"Operations\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe market tends to have a preference for technology companies because of the operational efficiencies that come from technology's scale. Simply put, data scientists help identify data and processes that can be automated to help achieve better operational efficiency.\n\nA concrete fintech example of this is fraud operations. If you're a bank with a credit card product, manually reviewing even 10% of your credit card transactions would be an impossible, and costly, task (it's been [cited](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-bitcoin-wont-displace-visa-or-mastercard-soon-2017-12-15) that Visa and Mastercard process 5,000 transactions per second, which would mean that there are 5000 * 60 * 60 * 24=432,000,000 transactions per day to go through).\n\nSo, in this circumstance data scientists build technology and predictive models to reduce the amount of manual review.\n\n## 2. Marketing\u003ca name=\"Marketing\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIn fintech, Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is everything. Others have written about [CAC and fintech](https://medium.com/unifimoney/the-no-cac-bank-5e0e577d5473) in greater depth, but suffice it to say it is a challenging and competitive problem.\n\nData scientists focused on marketing try to reduce CAC through a wide variety of strategies.\nSome of them are by tightly monitoring product metrics to see which features yield the best ROI for growth, while other approaches take a broader lense by taking a comprehensive view of your marketing investments and, again, optimize the expected return (e.g., through [Marketing Mix Models](https://blog.hurree.co/blog/marketing-mix-modeling)).\n\nOther marketing focused approaches use [propensity models](https://medium.com/the-official-integrate-ai-blog/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-propensity-modeling-521ab660cb43) to try to maximize customer engagement or acquisition. More concretely, this can involve building a propensity model to convert a customer from an email subscriber to a fully-converted user (e.g., for a lending product or a mobile application), while other propensities may focus on simply getting a customer to re-engage with your product.\n\n## 3. Risk Management\u003ca name=\"Risk-Management\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThis is where I've spent most of my career and I think it's a really hard problem that most fintechs struggle with in the lending space.\nGenerally speaking, data scientists will build risk models (e.g., for credit risk or fraud risk) to predict the probability of default or some likelihood of delinquency ([more on the difference between them](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062315/what-are-differences-between-delinquency-and-default.asp)).\n\nBuilding good predictive models is hard. Building good *risk* models is **extremely** hard.\n\nThis is less because of a technology or data problem and more because of regulatory checks and balances in place. Making sure that you adhere to [FCRA](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/fair-credit-reporting-act), [ECOA](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title15-chapter41-subchapter4\u0026edition=prelim), and other regulatory oversight is hard on its own, adding statistical analysis into the mix makes it more challenging.\n\nImplementation (i.e., getting an algorithm into production that impacts your customers) of these models is a whole other area of data science and one of the areas I personally find quite fun (maybe I'll write more about this topic later).\n\n## 4. Technology\u003ca name=\"Technology\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nData scientists often work with engineering/technology teams in order to improve the technology stack. This may involve changing an architecture to reduce the latency of certain [microservices](https://microservices.io/) or enhancing the curent stack for a unique problem (cue machine learning and [Airflow DAGs](https://airflow.apache.org)).\nWhile some of this is behind the scenes, it can be some of the most impactful work done by a data scientist in the fintech space because of the broader impact to the core business.\n\n## 5. Product\u003ca name=\"Product\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nData scientists working with product teams are often tasked with the measurement of different experiences within the product and finding out ways to enhance it. That can vary from creating dashboards to monitor the right metrics, to building a recommendation system to curate something specific for a user. \n\nData scientists can fuel product growth, which is why [Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft](https://www.datasciencedegreeprograms.net/lists/five-of-the-largest-companies-that-employ-data-scientists/) and other tech companies hire so many data scientists.\n\nIt's worth noting that I've ignored many of the technology and organizational complexities involved when hiring or building data science teams but only because I wanted to keep this post high-level to introduce some of the applications of data science to fintech. In the future, I'll probably write more technical posts of each one of these to give more concrete examples with code and diagrams (which is what I find fun ðŸ˜Š). \n\nTo summarize, data scientists are useful (particularly in fintech) when there are hard problems and data available to solve them.\n\n*Have some feedback?

He argued that the prolific [Carl Freidrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss) discovered [Ordinary Least Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares) (OLS) in 1809 and fundamentally shaped the future of science, business, and society as we know it.\n\nSo, what is OLS and why is it so important?\n\nOLS is often referred to by many things across several different discipilines, some of them are:\n\n- Linear Regression\n- Multivariate Regression\n- The Normal Equations\n- Maximum Likelihood\n- Method of Moments\n- Singular Value Decomposition of $\\bf{X}\\bf{w}-\\bf{y}=U(\\Sigma'\\bf{w}-U'-\\bf{y})$\n\nBut all of them ultimately reflect the same mathematical expression (in scalar notation):\n\n$$y_i = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\beta_i x_i + \\epsilon_i$$\n\nWhich yields the famous estimator (i.e., equation) for $\\hat{\\beta_j}$ as\n\n$$\\hat{\\beta_j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2 / \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$$\n\nOr in matrix notation:\n\n$$\\bf \\hat{\\beta} = \\bf (X'X)^{-1} X'Y$$.\n\nI find this simple equation to be so extraordinary.\n\nWhy? Because of what can be learned from it: the equation basically says \"Look at data about $\\bf{x}$ and estimate a linear relationship to $\\bf{y}$\". \n\nAs a concrete example, imagine you wanted to know the relationship between age and income (a simplification of the well-studied [Mincer Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincer_earnings_function)), how would you figure this out? A simple linear regression could estimate that relationship and the $\\hat{\\beta}$ would represent the partial-correlation (sometimes called the marginal effect or coefficient estimate) and it exactly represents the slope of the line below.\n\n![A scatter plot!](scatterplot.png)\n\u003cp align=\"center\" style=\"padding:0\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eA Scatter Plot of Age and Income\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nIsn't that just amazing??\n\nThis single expression is used to estimate models for movie recommendations, businesses, pharmaceuticals, and even decisions about public health. I am constantly amazed at how one little equation could accomplish so much.\n\nTo think Gauss had discovered OLS as a method of calculating the orbits of celestial bodies and that today, over 200 years later, humans would use it to for so much of what we do is astounding.\n\nOver the years statisticians, economists, computer scientists, engineers, and psychometricians have advanced OLS in such profound and unique ways. Some of them have been used to reflect data generated from more non-standard distributions (e.g., a [Weibull distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution)), or to frame the problem to use prior information in a structured way (e.g., through [Bayesian Inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference)), while others have enhanced these equations to learn high-dimensional non-linear relationships (e.g., via [Artificial Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)). Again, all of these are extended from the extraordinary work of Gauss.\n\nThere's so much that can be written about all of the advancements that have been made in all of these fields and a short blog post simply won't do it justice, but I thought I'd at least share some thoughts about it.\n\nSomewhere along the way today I came across something related to important equations and it led me to write this, so I hope you enjoyed it. \n\nI'm such a fan of the history of statistics and mathematics that this piece, while not as structured as I'd like, was very enjoyable to write.\n\nHappy computing!\n\n-Francisco"},{"slug":"2021-goals","frontmatter":{"title":"Goals for 2021","description":"Sharing some of my goals for 2021","date":"January 9, 2021"},"excerpt":"","content":"\n[I previously wrote about 2020](https://franciscojavierarceo.github.io/post/learning-new-things) and I found that reflecting about the chaos of this past year was rather cathartic for me.\n\nWhile I feel lucky to have endured the pandemic without contracting COVID or suffering job losses, it has been quite isolating. I know that I'm not alone in feeling that and we're all getting through this in our own ways. Regardless, I found that writing my thoughts out loud was helpful, so I suppose I'll continue writing for now.\n\nSince I'm going to try to write more I figured I'd share some of my goals for the new year; so, here are my foolish high-level goals in some unknown order:\n\n1. Be a better husband\n2. Talk less, listen more\n3. Cook more intentionally\n4. Speak more intentionally\n5. Help others more effectively\n6. Write at least 2x per month\n7. Exercise ~5x per week\n\nI hope I'm able to accomplish these. With the exclusion of the last two, these goals aren't particularly measurable (I'll probably find a way to measure them) but I hope to make a good effort. I hope to look back here and attempt to hold myself accountable. Maybe I'll provide an update in June, who knows.\n\nMore specific goals that I have that are much more technical in nature are:\n- Connecting Django Rest Framework (DRF) and React while handling data and localization complexities;\n- Deploying a React Native application to both app stores;\n- Putting in some more hours on Airflow / Cloud Composer;\n- Learning how to train my recommendation models on Kubernetes.\n\nThese will be interesting and I'm making progress on DRF and React but I still have quite a bit of work to do.\n\nHopefully this year will be better, I'm optimistic about it."},{"slug":"i-love-code","frontmatter":{"title":"I Love Code","description":"Some thoughts on the elegance of code.","date":"January 6, 2021"},"excerpt":"","content":"\nI love code. Plain and simple.\n\nI didn't always though. I started programming at 21 years old during my first masters---I was studying statistics and used code only as a means for running regression models and doing microeconometrics research. I started statistical programming back in 2011 using [STATA](https://www.stata.com/) and [SAS](https://www.sas.com/). They weren't *real* programming languages by a computer scientist's standards but that is technically how I started.\n\nI eventually moved onto to learning [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) when I started working and I found myself often writing Monte Carlo simulations of harmonic regressions, two stage least-squares, and other machine learning/statistical phenomenon.\n\nAnd that's how it started. I began learning [Python](https://www.python.org/) more actively at work and it mostly increased from there. During my second masters I started learning [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) in order to use [Torch](http://torch.ch/), which was used by [facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) before [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) was developed. Then at Goldman I had to learn proprietary tools like Slang. Now I've spent the last year learning much more about [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) and web development in general, and I just couldn't help but reflect and think about how much I actually *enjoy* it.\n\nIt's 2021 now and it's officially beeen a 10 year journey learning how to code (although what can only be argued as chaotically and poorly across different disciplines). Back when I first started I had no idea how anything in a computer worked and I was really, really bad at it. \n\nIt was miserable and I always felt deeply insecure about my code. I feel lucky now that I'm no longer code-shy and I don't struggle as much as I used to. That's not to say I don't have typos or bugs (I do!) but it's more to say that it's much easier these days for me to read through and understand how things are working and how to debug.\n\nBut that took me 10 years and it was a literal headache for most of the time. I'm curious to see what I'll feel in 10 years and what else I'll have learned.\n\nAll that just to show this beautiful piece of code, which is *a* way to write a function which takes as input *n* and yields its [Fibonacci Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).\n\n```python\ndef f(n: int) -\u003e int:\n    assert n\u003e0, 'n \u003e 0'\n    if n \u003c 3:\n        return {1:0, 2:1}[n]\n    return f(n-1) + f(n-2)\n```\n\nWhich simply encodes $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \\forall n \u003e 1$, where $F_1 = F_2 = 1$.\n\nThis code is both brief *and* elegant. That's what I love about it. In 5 little lines so much of human collaboration and information is represented. To think that 5 little lines could do all of that is astounding to me, I genuinely find it beauitful. I guess that's because I just love code."},{"slug":"github-actions","frontmatter":{"title":"Deploying a Next.js Site using Github Actions","description":"GitHub Actions to Deploy a Static Site built with Next.js","date":"January 3, 2021"},"excerpt":"","content":"\nI'm a huge fan of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). They're so simple but so effective at doing such a broad range of things. In short, you can tell GitHub do something on a computer everytime you push to your repository (or to a branch on a specific repository like the `main` branch).\n\nFor today's post, I'll focus on how I used an action to automate deploying my static site built with Next.js to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).\n\nI made this blog on a repository hosted on GitHub and added a GitHub Action to compile the JavaScript/React code into static HTML files. This really didn't require all that much effort.\n\n\nHere's what I had to do:\n\n1. Build a Next.js blog following the [detailed tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) and store the code on a GitHub repository\n2. Create a workflow file in the repository with the following path: [**./github/workflows/integrate.yml**](https://github.com/franciscojavierarceo/franciscojavierarceo.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/integrate.yml)\n3. Specify that workflow file to export the static files whenever I push to **main** and *commit* the exported files to a separate branch called **gh-pages** (you can just follow the workflow file I used)\n4. Manually add a **.nojekyll** file to the **gh-pages** branch (this is to resolve [this bug](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/2029))\n5. Configure my repository Settings so that it sources the GitHub Pages build from the **gh-pages** branch\n\nAnd that's it, adding new blog posts is as simple as creating a new [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) file and pushing to the **main** branch. The GitHub Action will handle all of the rest!\n\nThis is much nicer in behavior than my old site, which was built using Jekyll (a Ruby framework) and it's much less work than building a full application with Django to get high quality page loads.

Fortunately, along the way I was able to learn some new things. More specifically, I spent a lot of my time learning how to develop web applications (particularly in \u003ca href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\"\u003eDjango\u003c/a\u003e), which included:\n\n- Building a Content Management System (\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\"\u003eCMS\u003c/a\u003e)\n- Image optimization and various forms of cacheing\n- User authentication and security best practices (e.g., two factor authentication)\n- Developing APIs using Django Rest Framework\n- The benefits of JavaScript code compression/minification\n- How to adhere to SEO best practices for web content\n- Building Webhooks for 3rd party APIs\n- Building an application that handles multiple languages in a database, as an API, and that optimizes for SEO\n\nIt has been an interesting exercise to be much more hands on with JavaScript this past year, especially since my expertise is mainly in Python. As a data scientist, it's interesting to learn how the web is developed and how data is created from the web.\n\nIn statistics, the Data Generating Process (\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_generating_process\"\u003eDGP\u003c/a\u003e) is an extremely critical part of approximating the world with mathematical functions.

I think the knowledge investment I've made this past year has better helped me prepare for much faster growth going forward.\n\nWhat I've learned over the past 10 years is that investing in learning has exponential rewards, especially in time. Things that used to take me days or hours to accomplish can now be solved in minutes.\n\nSo, while my business didn't thrive this year, I do think I have learned a significant amount of information and that's invaluable.\n\nHere's to hoping 2021 is more balanced on learning and execution.
