I started this past year [writing about 2020](https://franciscojavierarceo.github.io/post/learning-new-things) and what I learned, so I thought I would do the same as it closed.\n\nThe end of 2019 and 2020 was a very big year for my family, as my wife and I moved to South Dakota, changed jobs, and bought a home. So quite a lot happend in the latest trip around the sun.\n\n# Learning\n\nI learned a lot this year, as I always try to do. Most of my focus was on software engineering, in part because of my job, and also because of my interests. So here's the list of things I've learned:\n\n- More Django, JavaScript, and React in general \n- More of the ever-evolving AWS ecosystem (it is both the same and very different than it was back in 2014)\n- React Native, mobile development, and deploying to the App Store (this is an exercise on its own)\n- The programming language Go\n- gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)\n\nLearning all of these things was mostly painful but also extremely fun. It takes a lot of patience and tinkering to learn to be effective with programming and I really do enjoy it. I find that I'm happiest most often when tinkering to solve new (at least new to me) computer-related puzzles, so it's been a very enjoyable year for me. In fact, we can see the data in the graph below showing all of the times I committed code:\n\n![That's a lot of commits!](2021-commit-count.png)\n\u003cp align=\"center\" style=\"padding:0\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eA visualization of my daily computering\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nA fun fact here is that if you compare this to 2020, you'll notice the massive jump in Pull Requests (PRs), which is a fun aside.\n\n# Career\n\nI joined [Fast](https://www.fast.co) last March and it's been an absolutely wild ride, which has been both intellectually fulfilling and exciting, which is a challenging combination to sustain in my experience. \n\nI have to say that of all of the organizations that I have worked for, Fast has been the most fun, which is unexpected since I work from home in South Dakota. By which I mean that I thought that not being in a physical office would have had a bigger influence on my perception of my enjoyment of my job but as it turns out, while I do miss working in an office, the work that I *actually do* is more important to me than being physically next to people that I'm doing the work with (it's not lost on me that this should be obvious but I'm often surprised how irrational or illogical my brain is about things of this nature). More than anything else, I think it's the people that really do make it great. The people that build the software and services, who are the same people that are kind and fun to work with.\n\nI've learned so much working at an extremely fast (pun intended) growing startup over the last 10 months and I really think it's unlikely I'll ever return to banking after working at an organization that values engineering as much as we do.\n\nI've gotten to the place where I feel confident in saying that I am a full stack engineer, which means I need to figure out what new things I'd like to learn next. \n\n# Next Year\n\nIn 2022, I hope to tackle a few big areas professionally:\n\n1. I still have much to learn as a software engineer, so I hope to continue learning from my amazing colleagues\n2. I think we built some really awesome products during my time @ Fast, but there's still so much left so I hope to continue to build and ship impactful products\n3. I want to continue iterating on things I've alreaddy built, specifically on my web and mobile app for [Unidos](https://www.getunidos.com)\n4. I hope to start learning more hardware as it's an area I have somewhat limited knowledge but lots of curiousity\n\nLet's hope I make some progress on those in 2022 and don't abandon (4). Overall I'm very grateful for this past year and I feel lucky to have spent it with the best person a guy could ask for.\n\nWishing you and your loved ones a Happy New Year.\n\n-Francisco\n"},{"slug":"2021-is-nearly-over","frontmatter":{"title":"2021 is nearly over","description":"Where did the time go?","date":"November 17, 2021"},"excerpt":"","content":"\nIt has been quite an extraordinary year and it has gone by terribly quickly, but I suppose that's a natural part of the aging process.\n\nSo far this year has gone completely differently than I had originally planned but I am grateful for it, it has been quite fun.\n\nReflecting briefly at my goals, which as I listed in my [previous blog](https://franciscojavierarceo.github.io/post/2021-goals) post were:\n\n```\n1. Be a better husband\n2. Talk less, listen more\n3. Cook more intentionally\n4. Speak more intentionally\n5. Help others more effectively\n6. Write at least 2x per month\n7. Exercise ~5x per week\n```\n\nI tried to improve on all of these items over the past year (some significantly more than others), but I'm not where I wanted to be on them.\n\nRegardless, I will say I learned a lot more this year by explicitly trying to improve these things. The goals I found most challengine were (1), (2), (5), and (6). I imagine this is because (1) is hard in general, (2) requires constant mental restraint from speaking up when I want to interject with a response or a thought, (5) doesn't truly realize its effectiveness in short time horizons, and (6) was simply not a priority.\n\nI'm mostly okay with the realities of this except (6), since writing requires being more intentional about my time and thoughts, which disappoints me as it suggests I was more chaotic than I wanted to be. As I grow older I realize how much more important it is to be increasingly more deliberate with the allocation of my time but I always struggle with choosing things as I really do enjoy working on and learning new things.\n\nAnyways, here's to hoping I'm more thoughtful with my time over the next couple of months and years.\n\nCheers,\nFrancisco"},{"slug":"toxic-bert-and-fast-api","frontmatter":{"title":"Bert Transformers, FastAPI, and Toxic Twitter","description":"A Data Scientist's Guide to using FastAPI and BERT to Build a twitter scanner of your tweets.","date":"April 11, 2021"},"excerpt":"","content":"\n## I will write less frequently\n\nUnfortunately, I've been writting a little less frequently than I was hoping to this year; I was targetting about once a week but I think that was (1) a little too frequent and (2) a little too ambitious of me to think I'd be able to keep up that pace.\n\n## I will write more quality\n\nI'll aim to write once or a month or so and hope for higher quality posts. \n\nIn the spirit of more interesting content (and more interesting problems for me to tinker with) in the Twitter thread below I decided I'd write a blog post on building a webtool that scans a user's historical tweets and identifies the highest risk ones.\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIs there an ML type service that can plow through history for potentially problematic tweets?\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; Matt Galligan (@mg) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mg/status/1372923621040082944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eMarch 19, 2021\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e \u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\nI decided to work on this because (1) it's at the intersection of things I really enjoy (nlp, web development, and twittter), (2) I wanted to build a tool that would solve a real problem, and (3) I thought it'd be fun.\n\n## Creating a Toxic Twitter Scanner\n\nI think this tool can be broken down into 3 sub-problems:\n1. Creating a web service to handle the front-end user experience (authentication and rendering of data)\n2. Creating a machine learning model as an endpoint that handles predicting the toxicity/problematicness of a user's tweets\n3. Connecting (1) and (2) and deploying them as a service in an automated way\n\nThere's a bunch of stuff in between and technical things to handle, but this is really what I think matters at a high-level, so let's dive in!\n\n### 1. Creating a Web Service\nAs a web tool, a user should be able to authenticate with Twitter to scan their tweets and consent to the service using their data (this is to access private tweets). As a starting point, I'll probably launch this tool without any authentication and just look at a user's public tweets.\n\n### 2. Creating a Machine Learning model as an API\nThis is a reasonably straightforward process as the endpoint will be a wrapper around an existing machine learning library and the goal is to be able to send in some data and get some scores back.\n\n### 3. Connecting a Web Service to an ML API\nThis is an important step. In summary, we want to decouple the user-facing experience from the machine learning because they have very different technical requirements. The compute cluster that'll create predictions for the tweets will use much more memory than the user-facing application, so it's important to separate them so computing doesn't slow down the user experience.\n\n## Progress on Building a Scanner\n\nSo far I've been diving into using a pre-trained BERT model developed by [Laura Hanu](https://laurahanu.github.io) at [Unitary](https://www.unitary.ai) and it's been pretty fun. I've been able to score my own tweets and see the behavior of this model and see various implementation details that I'll have to be mindful of (I'll probably write more on this later).\n\nI've been tinkering with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) and figuring out how the [cookie-cutter template](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/project-generation/) works. I don't love the way it behaves and there's a lot of strong opinions in place which is helpful but imperfect; we'll see how my opinion shapes as I spend more time with it.\n\nI'm very excited to learn [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/swarm-deploy/) as it seems like a very promising framework for deploying the model API.\n\nYou can follow my progress on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/franciscojavierarceo/twitter-scan). Stay tuned as I'll be updating this blog with my thoughts as I chip away at this problem.\n\n---\n*Have some feedback?

Register for a developer account on [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access) and get your API credentials\n\nThis is a pretty easy process and you just sign up and outline what you're doing (it's also free). Note that you'll need to store 4 variables in a `.env` file like below:\n\n    TWITTER_API_KEY=\n    TWITTER_API_SECRET=\n    TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=\n    TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=\n\n## 2. Write a Python Script to Tweet a Dog Photo\n\nThis was pretty straightforward thanks to the [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org) library in Python and this super random [dog photo API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) (God bless the internet).\n\nHere's what that Python code looks like:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport json\nimport requests\nimport tweepy\n\ndef get_random_dog(filename: str='temp') -\u003e None:\n    r = requests.get('https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random')\n    rd = json.loads(r.content)\n    r2 = requests.get(rd['message'])\n\n    with open(filename, 'wb') as image:\n        for chunk in r2:\n            image.write(chunk)\n\ndef main(message: str, filename: str='temp') -\u003e None:\n    auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(\n        os.environ.get('TWITTER_API_KEY'), \n        os.environ.get('TWITTER_API_SECRET')\n    )\n    auth.set_access_token(\n        os.environ.get('TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN'), \n        os.environ.get(\"TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET\")\n    )\n    api = tweepy.API(auth)\n    get_random_dog(filename) \n\n    try:\n        api.verify_credentials()\n        print(\"Twitter Authentication Succeeded\")\n    \n        try:\n            api.update_with_media(filename, status=message)\n            print('Tweet successfully sent!')\n\n        except Exception as e:\n            print('Error sending tweet \\n %s' % e)\n    except:\n        print(\"Twitter Authentication Failed\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main(\"Hey, @camdotbio! 👋 \\n\\nHere's your daily dog photo!\")\n```\n\n## 3. Create a Docker Container to run the Python Script \n\nThis is a contentious area where some may argue docker is execessive for this but I use different computers with different operating systems so this works for me and I like it. \n\nIn short, I created a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/franciscojavierarceo/twitter-cron-demo/blob/main/Dockerfile) and a [docker-compose](https://github.com/franciscojavierarceo/twitter-cron-demo/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file where I run the script. The benefit of this is that I don't have to worry about this script not working on my Linux machine or not working on my Mac, it works on both!\n\n## 4. Use a Github Action to Schedule a Cron Job\n\nThis was also straightforward and I've copied the code below:\n\n```yml\nname: Build and Deploy 🚀\n\non:\n    schedule:\n        - cron: '0 15 * * *'\n\njobs:\n    build:\n        runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n        steps:\n            - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n            - name: Make envfile\n              uses: SpicyPizza/create-envfile@v1\n              with:\n                  envkey_TWITTER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_API_KEY }}\n                  envkey_TWITTER_API_SECRET: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_API_SECRET }}\n                  envkey_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n                  envkey_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET }}\n                  file_name: .env\n\n            - name: Build the docker container\n              run: docker build .\n\n            - name: Run the script 🚀\n              run: docker-compose up\n```\nNote that you have to create [Action Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) in your Github Repository (available in the Settings tab) and add the credentials from Step 1.\n\n## Conclusion \n\nAnd that's it! 🐶 \n\nPushing the code to GitHub handles the rest, isn't that wonderful?\n\nAnyways, thanks to my internet friends for the fun idea. I didn't end up sending it to Camilo's phone number because I would have to pay Twilio $0.0075.\n\n---\n*Have some feedback?

You could take a sample of data and store it in a table, spreadsheet, or even a fancy database somewhere so you could analyze it.\n\nYou could then draw a scatter plot (like below) and *visualize* the relationship between the two attributes and fit (i.e., estimate) the relationship (i.e., the slope of that line). If the relationship was strictly **linear**, we'd see a scatter plot that looks something like the graph below.\n\n![A scatter plot!](scatterplot.png)\n\u003cp align=\"center\" style=\"padding:0\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eA Scatter Plot of Age and Income with a Linear Relationship\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nBut what if it wasn't linear?\n\nWhat if we knew Age only increased Income to a degree and that the marginal return was decreasing? Well, maybe we'd see a plot like below.\n\n![A scatter plot!](income_age_squared.jpeg)\n\u003cp align=\"center\" style=\"padding:0\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eA Scatter Plot of Age and Income with a Quadratic Relationship\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nWhat if things were a little less intuitive and, after another point, your Income (on average) started to go back up again? We'd see the graph below.\n\n![A scatter plot!](income_age_cubic.jpeg)\n\u003cp align=\"center\" style=\"padding:0\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eA Scatter Plot of Age and Income with a Cubic Relationship\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nLastly, what if we saw something that was just plain *weird*?\n\n![A scatter plot!](income_age_weird.jpeg)\n\u003cp align=\"center\" style=\"padding:0\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eA Scatter Plot of Age and Income with a Piecewise Linear, Discontinuous Function\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nThis is my favorite example because it shows a [piece-wise linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_linear_function) and, while strange looking, these relationships are very common phenomena in the wild.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause often times we are modeling behaviors or decisions by other systems in the world, and those systems, decisions, and behaviors often have weird boundary points/thresholds. In the credit world, you'll often see this because a lender's credit policy systematically rejects applications with a certain set of criteria, which would lead to visualizations identical to this.\n\n## What do we do with all of this information?\n\nThis is the fun part! \n\nIf you're doing data science and modeling data with lots of features/attributes, you probably don't want to do this for hundreds or thousands of different variables. Instead, you may benefit from finding a way to estimate the univariate relationship algorithmically. \n\nBut how?\n\nWhen you have a bivariate relationship like this you don't want to have to tediously [engineer features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering) to estimate the underlying function, rather you'd prefer to have a machine learn (or estimate) the function using [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning).\n\nBut which algorithm and how do I use it? Well, there are a few options people typically use:\n\n- [Polynomial Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression)\n- [Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_adaptive_regression_spline)\n- [Decision Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)\n- [Weight of Evidence](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc\u0026cdcVersion=9.4_3.3\u0026docsetId=casstat\u0026docsetTarget=casstat_binning_details03.htm\u0026locale=en)\n\nAnd each has its own unique benefits.\n\nBut my personal favorite is MARS. If we used R's [earth package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/earth/earth.pdf) we can estimate this function automatically in a few simple lines of code and get the predicted fit below.\n\n![A scatter plot!](income_age_mars.jpeg)\n\u003cp align=\"center\" style=\"padding:0\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eA Scatter Plot of Age and Income using Function Approximation\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nAnd here's the R code to generate it.\n\n```R\nlibrary(earth)\nearth.mod \u003c- earth(income ~ age, data = df)\nplotmo(earth.mod)\nprint(summary(earth.mod, digits = 2, style = \"pmax\"))\ndft$preds \u003c- predict(earth.mod, df)[,1]\n```\n\nShort, sweet, and effective—my favorite combination. \n\nThe other algorithms all have pros and cons, and I largely recommend to use each one depending on how smooth or *not*-smooth the underlying behavior of your data is (and how much you care to really account for it). \n\nAnyways, I hope you liked this post; it was a very enjoyable excuse for me to make some graphs.\n\n*Have some feedback?

I was doing my first master's in economics and statistics and I was doing econometrics research on consumer demand based on survey data using [SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/company-information.htmlhttps://www.sas.com/en_us/company-information/profile.html).\n\n![Look at that rise!](data-science-google-trends.png)\n\u003cp align=\"center\" style=\"padding:0\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eLooks like I graduated at an interesting time.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nTechnology was *much* different then, distributed computing and Open Source Software (OSS) was only starting to get the popularity and attention it has now. More practically, most businesses weren't using cloud services, they were using their own servers for storing and managing their data (i.e., real physical machines) with fixed RAM and a lot of overhead (read: chaos when the power goes out).\n\nThe most sophisticated analytical shops used SAS* to process their data since it was a very efficient way to analyze large data out of memory.\n\nBut it wasn't fault tolerant or stable. Software libraries for different mathematical frameworks have evolved so much over time and they just kept changing, so the infrastructure kept changing, too.\n\nIn short, the way data scientists did analytics was pretty brittle: most places didn't use version control or servers; code was sent via emails; and deploying models was usually done in an Oracle/MySQL table that ran a query, joins, and a sum-product. It was the Wild West.\n\nCloud computing and OSS changed the game. [R](https://cran.r-project.org), [Python](https://www.python.org), [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org), [Spark](https://spark.apache.org), [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit), and other frameworks completely influenced how we thought about that infrastructure.\n\nPython, in particular, has been one of the greatest contributions to data science and it has truly helped push the field further.\n\n## Python, the Beautiful\n\nPython wasn't the original data science language, R and SAS were much more popular back in the early and mid-2010s but two popular data mining libraries helped Python skyrocket in the data science community ([sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [xgboost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost)). Then in 2015 people made advances in deep learning frameworks (moving away from [Theano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theano_(software))) and creating things like [Caffe](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org), [Keras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keras), [Tensorflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow), and eventually [PyTorch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyTorch) (my personal favorite).\n\nAll of the stuff under the hood changed dramatically and it made the infrastructure around deploying these models change dramatically, too.\n\nThe ever-evolving software made getting data science infrastructure up and running really annoying, time consuming, and eventually kind of wasteful because it would get stale quickly, but the world has evolved again.\n\nCue [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) and the emergence of [containerization](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-containerization-83ae53a709a6).\n\n## Docker and Jupyter Notebooks\n\nDocker is basically a way to easily configure a mini-computer in your computer. The idea being, that if you configure it with a single file declaring what stuff (i.e., software) you need in it, you can deploy that same container to some production environment. In real, customer-facing applications even a small subversion change of a single library can break your entire service.\n\nDocker can help mitigate that risk.\n\n![It works on my machine!](docker.jpg)\n\u003cp align=\"center\" style=\"padding:0\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis meme is suprisingly accurate.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nWhat's interesting is that people have made attempts at doing similar things for a long time ([virtual environments](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), [virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org), etc.) and while most of them were helpful, they all still had really annoying issues come up constantly...but Docker is much more comprehensive.\n\nSo how is that relevant for Python and data scientists? Well, if you're doing data science work, odds are you're probably using Python or R and you might be doing that work using a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org). \n\nThe [Jupyter Project](https://jupyter.org/about) has created a wonderful [Data Science](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook/) docker image that allows you to trivially get up and running.\n\nAll you have to do is [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and run the following in your terminal:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v /your/folder/:/home/jovyan/work --rm --name jupyter jupyter/datascience-notebook\n```\nYou'll see some output and at the end of it you should see something like: \n\n```\n[C 2021-02-14 14:37:06.596 ServerApp] \n    \n    To access the server, open this file in a browser:\n        file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jpserver-6-open.html\n    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:\n        http://7c94e4cf2dc1:8888/lab?token=this-will-be-a-magical-token\n     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=this-will-be-a-magical-token\n```\nClick on that link in your terminal and you should be directed to a page that looks like the image below:\n\n![So many options!](docker-for-data-science.png)\n\u003cp align=\"center\" style=\"padding:0\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eWho is using Julia these days?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nAnd there you have it, you can start ripping through all sorts of data in minutes!\n\nA great benefit of this particular docker image is that it has most of the Python/R libraries you want already out of the box but if you want to add another, you can do that right in your notebook by using [Jupyter Magic](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) in a cell like so:\n```bash\n%pip install snowflake\n```\n\n![Simple install](pip_install.png)\n\u003cp align=\"center\" style=\"padding:0\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eWow, that was easy.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nAnd now you can use that library. See how nice it is not to have to [dual boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-booting) your computer to install something?\n\n## Conclusion\n\nData science infrastructure is going to continue to evolve very heavily, so I imagine this post will be outdated in 2 years but currently this is an extremely fast and painless way to get up and running.\n\nI can't emphasize enough how miserable managing different Operating System (OS), Python, or other software library versions really is. Debugging these things used to take days or weeks and now it's just trivial, so I'd really recommend this approach. An added benefit is that this will also save you an extraordinary amount of time when you go to deploy your model...but more on that later. 😉\n\n*Have some feedback?

Most of the large banks, pharmaceutical firms, several government agencies, research institutions, and other major organizations in the world still operate on SAS because it's so deeply embedded into their business. Now, that technology can no longer be decoupled from their core infrastructure, which is interesting.*"},{"slug":"customer-segmentation-data-science","frontmatter":{"title":"Customer Segmentation using Data Science","description":"A Data Scientists Guide to Segmenting your Customers using clustering algorithms and decision trees.","date":"February 6, 2021"},"excerpt":"","content":"\n*TL;DR: A Data Science Tutorial on using K-Means and Decision Trees together.*\n\nCustomer segmentation (sometimes called [Market Segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation)) is ubiqutous in the private sector. We think about bucketing people into $k$ mutually exclusive and collectively exhausting (MECE) groups. The premise being that instead of having 1 strategy for delivering a product or experience, providing $k$ experiences or strategies will yield much better engagement or acquisition from our customers.\n\nGenerally speaking, this makes sense; it's intuitive. Provide people a more curated experience and they will enjoy it more...and the more personalized the better. \n\nNetflix, Spotify, YouTube, Twiter, Instagram, and all of the big tech companies have mastered personalization by using robust, computationally expensive, and sophisticated machine learning pipelines. But the world has been doing this for a long time, just a much less sophisticated version.\n\nSo I thought I'd give a technical demo of what customer segmentation looks like in a basic way using a trick I've used for years.\n\nHere are the things I'd like to cover during this demo:\n\n1. What options do I have to segment my customers?\n2. How do I actually do the segmentation?\n3. What can I do with my new customer segments?\n4. How do I know that my segments are effective?\n5. How do I know when my segments have changed?\n\n## Approaches to Customer Segmentation\n\nThe phrase \"Customer Segments\" tends to mean different things across different industries, organizations, and even across business functions (e.g., marketing, risk, product, etc.). \n\nAs an example, for a consumer products retailer, they may refer to customer segments using both demographic information or their purchase behavior, where a lender may refer to their segments based on credit score bands. While very meaningfully different from a business perspective, the same algorithms can be used for both problems.\n\nAnalytically speaking, I've seen Customer Segments defined really in two main ways: (1) Business Segments and (2) Algorithmic Segments. Usually executives refer to their segments in the first category and data scientists focus on the second. The first is really important organizationally because 99% of the people working with your customers don't care about how you bucketed them and customers are the most important thing. Always.\n\n...but how do you *actually* (i.e., in code and data) get to those segments?\n\n### 1. Logical Business Segments\nThese segments tend to be defined by heuristics and things that make common sense. They are often built on things that are aligned with the goal of the business.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n- The age of the customer (in years)\n- The income of the customer (in dollars or thousands of dollars)\n- The amount of money a customer spent in the last year\n- The likelihood a customer will spend money at a given store (purchase propensity / propensity to buy)\n- The customer's geographic region (e.g., zipcode, state)\n\nIn data, some of that customer information would look something like this:\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003eUser ID\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003eAge\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003eCustomer Income\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003ePurchase Propensity\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003e...\u003c/th\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e1\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e25\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e$45,000\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e0.9\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e2\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e30\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e$80,000\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e0.4\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003en\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e56\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e$57,000\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e0.1\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\nAnd so on.\n\nWe could apply some logic/rules/code to create segment like:\n\n- Age Buckets\n    1. \u003c 25\n    2. 25-35\n    3. 35-55\n    4. 55+\n- Income Buckets\n    1. \u003c $25K\n    2. $25K-50K\n    3. $50K-100K\n    4. $100-150K\n    5. $150K+\n- Propensity Buckets\n    1.

The code for this categorization is simple too (assuming you're using Pandas and Python; though it's also simple in SQL).\n\n```python\n# Here's one example\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ncdf['Income Bucket'] = pd.cut(cdf['Annual Income ($K)'], \n    bins=[0, 25, 35, 55, np.inf], \n    labels=['\u003c25', '25-35', '35-55', '55+']\n)\n```\nThis is a really helpful and simple way to understand our customers and it's the way that most businesses do analytics, but we can do more. 😊\n\n### 2. Algorithmic Segments\n\nSegments defined using simple business logic are great because they are so easy to interpret, but that's not free.\nBy favoring simplicity we have to limit ourselves to (potentially) suboptimal segments. \nThis is typically on purpose and entirely fine but, again, we can do better.\n\nSo how do we do better?\n\nCue statistics, data mining, analytics, machine learning, or whatever it's called this week. More specifically, we can use the classic [K-Means Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) algorithm to *learn* an optimal set of segments given some set of data.\n\nTo skip over many important details ([more here](https://towardsdatascience.com/customer-segmentation-using-k-means-clustering-d33964f238c3)), K-Means is an algorithm that optimally buckets your data into $K$ groups (according to a specific mathematical function called the [euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)). It's a classic approach and tends to work quiet well in practice (there are a ton of other neat [clustering algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis#Algorithms)) but one non-technical challenge is (1) choosing $K$ and (2) explaining what a single cluster actually means to literally anyone else.\n\nSolving (1) is relatively straight-forward. You can run K-means for some number of $K$ from [0, $m$] ($m \u003e 0$ and choose what appears to be a $k$ that sufficiently minimizes the within-cluster sum-of-squares (i.e., $\\sum_{i=0}^{n} min_{\\mu_j \\in C}||x_i - \\mu_j||^2$). Here notice that the the majority of the variation of the clusters can be capture by $k=6$.\n\n![The Inertia Function!](inertia.png)\n\u003cp align=\"center\" style=\"padding:0\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eInertia as a function of k\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nNow to (2), which is the harder challenge. If I were to plot my data and look at the clusters, I'd have something that looks like:\n\n![K-Means!](kmeans.png)\n\u003cp align=\"center\" style=\"padding:0\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eLook at all 3 of those beautiful dimensions!\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nHow cool, right? This little algorithm learned pretty clear groups that you can see rather obviously in the data. Impressive! And also useless to your boss and colleagues.\n\nMore seriously, while you can see these clusters, you can't actually extract a clear description from it, which makes interpreting it really, really hard when you go past 3 dimensions.\n\nSo what can you do to make this slightly more meaningful?\n\nEnter [decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree). Another elegant, classic, and amazing algorithm. Decision Trees basically split up your data using simple `if-else` statements. So, a trick that you can use is to take the predicted clusters and run a Decision Tree (Classification) to predict the segment and use the learneed Tree's logic as your new business logic.\n\nI find this little trick pretty fun and effective since I can more easily describe how a machine learned a segment and I can also inspect it. Let's suppose I ran my tree on this learned K-means, what would the output look like?\n\n![Decision Tree Ouput!](decisiontree.png)\n\u003cp align=\"center\" style=\"padding:0\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eIs this really more interpretable?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nThere you have it, now you have a segmentation that is closer to optimal and somewhat easier to interpret. It's still not as good as the business definition but you could actually read through this and eventually come up with a heuristic driven approach as well, which is why I like it and why I've used it in the past.\n\nAnd here's the code to run the K-means and the Decision tree.\n\n```python\nimport pydotplus\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import export_graphviz\nfrom sklearn.externals.six import StringIO  \n\noptimal_clusters = 6\n# 6 clusters 6 colors\nxcolors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'orange', 'purple', 'gray']\n# Chose 6 as the best number of clusters\nkmeans_model = (KMeans(n_clusters = optimal_clusters,init='k-means++', n_init = 10 ,max_iter=300, \n                        tol=0.0001,  random_state= 111  , algorithm='elkan') )\nkmeans_model.fit(X1)\ncdf['pred_cluster_kmeans'] = kmeans_model.labels_\ncentroids = kmeans_model.cluster_centers_\n\ndisplay(pd.DataFrame(cdf['pred_cluster_kmeans'].value_counts(normalize=True)))\n\nclf = DecisionTreeClassifier()\n# Train Decision Tree Classifer\nclf = clf.fit(X1, cdf['pred_cluster_kmeans'])\n\n# Predict the response for test dataset\ncdf['pred_class_dtree'] = clf.predict(X1)\n\ndisplay(pd.crosstab(cdf['pred_cluster_kmeans'], cdf['pred_class_dtree']))\ndot_data = StringIO()\nexport_graphviz(\n    decision_tree=clf, \n    out_file=dot_data,  \n    filled=True, \n    rounded=False,\n    impurity=False,\n    special_characters=True, \n    feature_names=xcol_labels, \n    class_names=cdf['pred_cluster_kmeans'].unique().astype(str).tolist(),\n\n)\ngraph = pydotplus.graph_from_dot_data(dot_data.getvalue())  \ngraph.write_png(\"./decisiontree.png\")\n```\n## What can you do with your new segments?\n\nNow that we have our customer segments we can do all sorts of different things.\nWe can create [A/B tests](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/ab-testing/) for website experiences or we can test the impact of [changing our prices](https://medium.com/@judaikawa/price-elasticity-statistical-modeling-in-the-retail-industry-a-quick-overview-fdab5350222) to certain customers.\nIn general, we can just try a bunch of new stuff.\n\n## How do I know if my segments are accurate?\n\nThe metric we used in the example above (i.e., within cluster sum-of-squares / inertia) was a reasonably straightforward way to measure the accuracy of your segments from an analytical perspective, but if you wanted to take a closer look, I'd recommend reviewing individual users in each segment. It sounds a little silly and can, in some cases, lead to the wrong conclusions but I firmly believe that in data science, you just have to really **look** at your data. You learn a lot from it.\n\n## How do I know when my segments need to change?\n\nLastly, segments can change; your customers are always evolving so it's good to re-evaluate your clusters time and again. The emergence of new segments should feel very obvious, since it may be driven by product or acquisition changes. As a concrete example, if you noticed that important businesss metrics split by your segments are starting to behave a little differently, then you can investigate whether it's driven by a change in the segments; sometimes it is, sometimes it's not.\n\n\n## Conclusion\nThis tutorial ended up being a little longer than I anticipated but oh well, I hope you enjoyed it.\n\nI've stored the code to reproduce this example in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/franciscojavierarceo/Python/blob/master/demos/Customer%20Segmentation%20Example.ipynb) available on my GitHub (note to render the interactive 3D visualization you have to run the notebook). To get it up and running you only need to download the notebook, [download the data](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python), install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started), and simply run:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v ~/path/to/your/folder/:/home/jovyan/work --rm --name jupyter jupyter/scipy-notebook:17aba6048f44\n```\n\nAnd you should be good to go.

I learned a lot from those experiences, so I thought I'd share a simple example of how one of the core pieces of algorithmic/quantitative underwriting is done.\n\nIn this post, I'll try to answer the following questions:\n\n- What is a credit risk model?\n- What data does a credit risk model use?\n- How do you estimate a credit risk model?\n- How do you know if your model is performing well?\n- What are some common mistakes to avoid?\n- What are useful facts to know about credit risk models?\n\nIt's worth caveating up front that this is a very narrow take focused only on the analytical aspect of the work and there is an extraordinary amount of legal, compliance, and business work that I am intentionally omitting.\n\nWith that said, let's dive right in.\n\n## What is a Credit Risk Model?\n\nIn the consumer/retail space, a credit risk model tries to predict the probability that a consumer won't repay money that they've borrowed.\nA simple example of this is an [unsecured personal loan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredloan.asp). \n\nLet's suppose you submitted an application to borrow $5,000 from a lender. That lender would want to know the likelihood of [default](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) before deciding on (1) whether to give you the loan and (2) the price they want to charge you for borrowing the money. So that probability is probably quite important...but how do they come up with it?\n\n## What Data does a Credit Risk Model Use?\n\nLenders typically use data from the major [Credit Bureaus](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/top-three-credit-bureaus/) that is [FCRA](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/fair-credit-reporting-act) compliant, which basically means that the legal and reputational risk of using this data is very low.\n\nTypically, you'd purchase a dataset from one of the bureaus (or use data inside one of their analytical sandboxes) and clean the dataset into something that looks like the following:\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003eDefault\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003eInquiries in Last 6 Months\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003eCredit Utilization\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003eAverage Age of Credit\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003cth\u003e...\u003c/th\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003eYes\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e2\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e0.8\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e12\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003eNo\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e8\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e0.0\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e2\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003ctd\u003e...\u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn summary, it's just a bunch of data about your borrowing history.\nIt's a little recursive/cyclical because in order to grow your credit you need to have credit but let's ignore that detail.\n\nOne of the most important steps in the model development process is *precisely* defining **default** because this will eventually reflect the performance of your portfolio defining it thoughtfully, accurately, and confidently is extremely consequential.\n\nSo how do you define it?\n\nTime. \n\nIf you're planning to launch a term loan, you usually set boundaries on the duration of the loan. For revolving lines of credit (like a credit card), you simply apply a reasonable boundary on time that makes good business sense.\n\nLet's say you want to launch a 12 month loan to an underserved market, then you'd want to get historical data of other lenders to build your model on.\nIt sounds a little surprising that you can do this but that's basically how the bureaus make their money.\n\nAn important thing to keep in mind is that you need to make sure you pull the data at 2 different time periods: (1) when the original application was made so you can use data that is relevant for underwriting (and so you don't have forward-looking data resulting in [data leakage](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/data-leakage)) and (2) 12 months later (or whatever time period is appropriate for you) to check if the consumer defaulted on their loan.\n\nThere's a lot more to it and you can expand on things in much more elegant ways to handle different phenomena but for the sake of simplicity, this is essentially how it's done.\n\nSo, after painfully cleaning up all that data, what do you do with it?\n\n## Building a Probability of Default Model\n\nNow that you have that glorious dataset you can start to run different [Logistic Regressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) or use other classification based [machine learning](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/08/10-algorithms-machine-learning-engineers.html) algorithms to find hidden patterns and relationships (i.e., [non-linear functions](https://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/what-is-the-difference-between-linear-and-nonlinear-equations-in-regression-analysis#:~:text=If%20the%20equation%20doesn't,a%20linear%20equation%2C%20it's%20nonlinear.\u0026text=Thetas%20represent%20the%20parameters%20and,one%20parameter%20per%20predictor%20variable.) and [interaction terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics))).\n\nPersonally, this is the most intellectually engaging part of the work. The other work involved in credit risk modeling is usually very stressful and filled with less exciting graphs but here you get to pause, look at data, and, for a moment, try to make a crude approximation of the world. I find this part *fascinating*.\n\nIf we stick with our simple dataset above for our model, we could use our good old friend Python to run that Logistic Regression.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n# Generating the data \nn = 10000\nnp.random.seed(0)\nx_1 = np.random.poisson(lam=5, size=n)\nx_2 = np.random.poisson(lam=2, size=n)\nx_3 = np.random.poisson(lam=12, size=n)\ne = np.random.normal(size=n, loc=0, scale=1.)\n\n# Setting the coefficient values to give us a ~5% default rate\nb_1, b_2, b_3 = -0.005, -0.03, -0.15\nylogpred =  x_1 * b_1 + x_2 * b_2 + x_3 * b_3 + e\nyprob = 1./ (1.+ np.exp(-ylogpred))\nyclass = np.where(yprob \u003e= 0.5, 1, 0)\nxs = np.hstack([\n    x_1.reshape(n, 1), \n    x_2.reshape(n, 1), \n    x_3.reshape(n, 1)\n])\n# Adding an intercept to the matrix\nxs = sm.add_constant(xs)\nmodel = sm.Logit(yclass, xs)\n# All that work just to run .fit(), how terribly uninteresting\nres = model.fit()\nprint(res.summary())\n\n         Current function value: 0.163863\n         Iterations 8\n                           Logit Regression Results                           \n==============================================================================\nDep.

This chart may look fancy but it's actually pretty simple, it's just [deciling](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decile.asp) your data (i.e., sorting and bucketing into 10 equal groups) according to the *predicted* default rate from your model. It's worth noting that this is a quantized and reversed version of the [ROC chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) and they represent the same information.\n\nThere are 3 important pieces of information from this graph: \n\n1. The AUC tells you the performance\n2. The closer the two lines are together the more accurate the probability estimate\n3. The steeper the slope at the higher deciles, the better the rank order separation\n\nIf you had perfect information, you'd get a graph that looks like this:\n\n![The Perfect Lift Chart!](liftchart_optimal.png)\n\u003cp align=\"center\" style=\"padding:0\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eIf your model looks like this, you've done something terribly wrong\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nAnd here's the code to generate those graphs.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\n\ndef liftchart(df: pd.DataFrame, actual: str, predicted: str, buckets: int=10) -\u003e None:\n    # Bucketing the predictions (Deciling is the default)\n    df['predbucket'] = pd.qcut(x=df[predicted], q=buckets)\n    sdf = df[[actual, predicted, 'predbucket']].groupby(\n        by=['predbucket']).agg({\n        actual: [np.mean, sum, len], \n        predicted: np.mean\n        }\n    )\n    aucperf = roc_auc_score(df[actual], df[predicted])\n    sdf.columns = sdf.columns.map(''.join) # I hate pandas multi-indexing\n    sdf = sdf.rename({\n        actual + 'mean': 'Actual Default Rate', \n        predicted + 'mean': 'Predicted Default Rate'\n    }, axis=1)\n    sdf[['Actual Default Rate', 'Predicted Default Rate']].plot(\n        kind='line', style='.-', grid=True, figsize=(12, 8), \n        color=['red', 'blue']\n    )\n    plt.ylabel('Default Rate')\n    plt.xlabel('Decile Value of Predicted Default')\n    plt.title('Actual vs Predicted Default Rate sorted by Predicted Decile \\nAUC = %.3f' % aucperf)\n    plt.xticks(\n        np.arange(sdf.shape[0]), \n        sdf['Predicted Default Rate'].round(3)\n    )\n    plt.show()\n\n# Using the data and model from before!\npdf = pd.DataFrame(xs, columns=['intercept', 'x1', 'x2', 'x3'])\npdf['preds'] = res.predict(xs)\npdf['actual'] = yclass\n\n# Finally, what we all came here to see\nliftchart(pdf, 'actual', 'preds')\n\n# This is what it looks like when we have perfect information\npdf['truth'] = pdf['actual'] + np.random.uniform(low=0, high=0.001, size=pdf.shape[0])\nliftchart(pdf, 'actual', 'truth', 10)\n```\n\u003ccenter\u003e\u003ci\u003eJudge me not by the elegance of my code but by the fact that it runs.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\n\n## Evaluating your Default Model\n\nSo this visualization is helpful, but how do you quantify the performance into a single number? Well, how about [Accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision)?\n\nIt turns out that Accuracy isn't really a great metric when you have a low default rate (or more generally when you have severe [class imbalance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_paradox)). As an example suppose you have a 5% default rate, that means 95% of your data did *not default*, so if your model predicted that no one defaulted, you'd have 95% accuracy.\n\nAccurate, obvious, and entirely useless. Without proper adjustment, this behavior is actually very likely to occur in your model, so we tend to ignore the accuracy metric and instead we focus on the rank order seperation/predictive power of the model.\n\nTo measure that predictive power, there are 4 metrics industry professionals typically look at to summarize their model: [Precision, Recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall), the [Kolomogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov–Smirnov_test), and [Gini/AUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve).\n\nOne point of humor that has been a surprisingly common topic of discussion in my career is the equivalence of Gini and AUC. Bankers like Gini, for whatever inertia related reason, but it's equivalent to AUC via:\n\n$$Gini = 2 * AUC - 1$$ \n\nand obviously\n\n$$AUC = \\frac{Gini+1}{2}$$.\n\nGini is bound between [-1, 1] and AUC between [0, 1] but technically if your AUC is less than 0.5 (and \u003c 0 for Gini) that means you're doing worse than random ([and you could do better by literally doing the opposite of what your model says](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/266387/can-auc-roc-be-between-0-0-5)) so most people will say AUC is between [0.5, 1] and that Gini is between [0, 1].\n\nA good model is usually around 70% AUC / 40% Gini. The higher the better.\n\nIt's always useful to look at your lift chart as it can tell you a lot about how predictive the model is at different deciles. In some cases, your model may not have enough variation in the attributes/features/predictors to differentiate your data meaningfully. The metric won't show you that, only a glance at the lift chart will, so it's always a good to review it.\n\nOne important point here is that any single metric is very crude and a data set can be pathologically constructed to break it, so while these metrics and charts are very helpful, there are cases where things can still misbehave even though they seem normal.\n\nNow that you have your exciting new default model, you can use it in your underwriting strategy to differentiate amongst your competitors on pricing, approve/decline, and targeting customers, right?\n\nNot quite.\n\n## Common Mistakes and Pitfalls\n\nBefore you get too excited about your model, you want to verify that it's behaving logically, so I thought I'd list some items that you will want to check against to make sure nothing disastrous will happen. \n\n- Double check for [Data Leakage](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/data-leakage)\n- Verify that you don't have any [data errors](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/common-errors-in-machine-learning-due-to-poor-statistics-knowledg)\n- Make sure you've done your best not to fall for [Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox)\n- Validate your model with an [Out of Time](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/22/30560/) Hold Out Sample\n- Confirm your model actually has a [representative sample](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/representative-sample.asp#:~:text=A%20representative%20sample%20is%20a,three%20males%20and%20three%20females.) of your future portfolio\n- Make sure you're not time traveling \n    - This is a form of Data Leakage (Leaky Predictors) and it's basically making sure you don't use data that's in the future of what you're representing (except the default flags that you're trying to predict/model)\n- Understand the correlation your *predicted default* may have to your other products in your portfolio\n    - This is not important from a statistical perspective but it is very important for your business\n- Always be skeptical if your model performs too well\n    - This is very likely data leakage and can be very embarrassing if you over-excite management\n\nI could have written a book ([recommendation here](https://www.amazon.com/Credit-Risk-Modelling-Theoretical-Foundations-Diagnostic-ebook/dp/B07FZGG63V)) with a much longer set of information both from a statistical and business lense but, for the sake of brevity, I wrote the most pressing ones and I invite you to search for more information about other important details.\n\n## Some other Interesting Extensions\n\n\n### Model Extensions\nThe model I showed above is quite literally the most basic example and the models that most lenders and vendors use are much, much more sophisticated. Many of them have enhanced their models to handle [panel data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel_data) (i.e., cohorts of people over time) and can construct models that are extremely robust.\n\nThe best class of models in this elite category (in my personal opinion) are [Discrete Time Survival Models](https://bookdown.org/content/4253/fitting-basic-discrete-time-hazard-models.html). Actually, this isn't *my* opinon, this wisdom was shared with me from two of the former heads of statistical modeling at Capital One, so don't trust my judgement, trust theirs.\n\n### Quantization and the Weight of Evidence\nAnother interesting implementation detail is that statisticians/data scientists in the credit scoring space often transform the inputs/attributes/features of their model via [quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization). More specifically through a transformation called the [Weight of Evidence](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/08/13/weight-of-evidence/). It's neat, troglodytic, and surprisingly effective.\n\n\n### Adverse Action Reasons\nCredit risk modeling requires the underwriter to grant adverse action codes in the case of rejecting a customer who applies for a credit product (this is a driven by the FCRA). Doing this algorithmitically is very doable and different organizations do it slightly differently but the short version is you take the absolute largest partial predictions (i.e., $argmax_{x}f(x_j) = |x_j * \\beta_j|$,  $\\forall j=1,..., k$).\n\n### Model Complexity and Usefulness\nLastly, when building these statistical models the most important thing to think about is the trade-off between complexity and performance on your target population. Typically in the lending space you will not approve all of your customers, so obsessing over model fit on the proportion of your population that won't be approved is not always useful. It's a small point, but extremely consequential and will hopefully save you some time.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis tutorial was not nearly as code heavy as I would have liked (only showing a very silly regression) but I felt like the content was still rather dense ([the full code is available here](https://github.com/franciscojavierarceo/Python/blob/master/demos/credit-model-demo.py)).\n\nPeople spend their careers studying these statistical models and the important consequences of them, so I really want to emphasize how much I have trivialized the work here only for the sake of simplicity. I have not talked about how you can improve the model when it's underperforming or how one can try to measure biases that may occur, but these are important pieces for society.\n\nI will conclude by saying that these models are heavily governed by many layers of regulation. As a statistician and a minority, I think this is a good thing.\nThat's not to say that harm isn't caused by these models because I think there is but I do think machines are more easily governed, evaluated, and modified...unlike human decision making which can be subjective and prone to unknown biases that are difficult to quantify ([here's some additional reading material](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/morse/research/papers/discrim.pdf)).\n\nI hope you found this post useful and interesting.\n\n*Have some feedback?

Operations\u003ca name=\"Operations\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe market tends to have a preference for technology companies because of the operational efficiencies that come from technology's scale. Simply put, data scientists help identify data and processes that can be automated to help achieve better operational efficiency.\n\nA concrete fintech example of this is fraud operations. If you're a bank with a credit card product, manually reviewing even 10% of your credit card transactions would be an impossible, and costly, task (it's been [cited](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-bitcoin-wont-displace-visa-or-mastercard-soon-2017-12-15) that Visa and Mastercard process 5,000 transactions per second, which would mean that there are 5000 * 60 * 60 * 24=432,000,000 transactions per day to go through).\n\nSo, in this circumstance data scientists build technology and predictive models to reduce the amount of manual review.\n\n## 2. Marketing\u003ca name=\"Marketing\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nIn fintech, Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is everything. Others have written about [CAC and fintech](https://medium.com/unifimoney/the-no-cac-bank-5e0e577d5473) in greater depth, but suffice it to say it is a challenging and competitive problem.\n\nData scientists focused on marketing try to reduce CAC through a wide variety of strategies.\nSome of them are by tightly monitoring product metrics to see which features yield the best ROI for growth, while other approaches take a broader lense by taking a comprehensive view of your marketing investments and, again, optimize the expected return (e.g., through [Marketing Mix Models](https://blog.hurree.co/blog/marketing-mix-modeling)).\n\nOther marketing focused approaches use [propensity models](https://medium.com/the-official-integrate-ai-blog/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-propensity-modeling-521ab660cb43) to try to maximize customer engagement or acquisition. More concretely, this can involve building a propensity model to convert a customer from an email subscriber to a fully-converted user (e.g., for a lending product or a mobile application), while other propensities may focus on simply getting a customer to re-engage with your product.\n\n## 3. Risk Management\u003ca name=\"Risk-Management\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThis is where I've spent most of my career and I think it's a really hard problem that most fintechs struggle with in the lending space.\nGenerally speaking, data scientists will build risk models (e.g., for credit risk or fraud risk) to predict the probability of default or some likelihood of delinquency ([more on the difference between them](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062315/what-are-differences-between-delinquency-and-default.asp)).\n\nBuilding good predictive models is hard. Building good *risk* models is **extremely** hard.\n\nThis is less because of a technology or data problem and more because of regulatory checks and balances in place. Making sure that you adhere to [FCRA](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/fair-credit-reporting-act), [ECOA](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title15-chapter41-subchapter4\u0026edition=prelim), and other regulatory oversight is hard on its own, adding statistical analysis into the mix makes it more challenging.\n\nImplementation (i.e., getting an algorithm into production that impacts your customers) of these models is a whole other area of data science and one of the areas I personally find quite fun (maybe I'll write more about this topic later).\n\n## 4. Technology\u003ca name=\"Technology\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nData scientists often work with engineering/technology teams in order to improve the technology stack. This may involve changing an architecture to reduce the latency of certain [microservices](https://microservices.io/) or enhancing the curent stack for a unique problem (cue machine learning and [Airflow DAGs](https://airflow.apache.org)).\nWhile some of this is behind the scenes, it can be some of the most impactful work done by a data scientist in the fintech space because of the broader impact to the core business.\n\n## 5. Product\u003ca name=\"Product\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nData scientists working with product teams are often tasked with the measurement of different experiences within the product and finding out ways to enhance it. That can vary from creating dashboards to monitor the right metrics, to building a recommendation system to curate something specific for a user. \n\nData scientists can fuel product growth, which is why [Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft](https://www.datasciencedegreeprograms.net/lists/five-of-the-largest-companies-that-employ-data-scientists/) and other tech companies hire so many data scientists.\n\nIt's worth noting that I've ignored many of the technology and organizational complexities involved when hiring or building data science teams but only because I wanted to keep this post high-level to introduce some of the applications of data science to fintech. In the future, I'll probably write more technical posts of each one of these to give more concrete examples with code and diagrams (which is what I find fun 😊). \n\nTo summarize, data scientists are useful (particularly in fintech) when there are hard problems and data available to solve them.\n\n*Have some feedback?

He argued that the prolific [Carl Freidrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss) discovered [Ordinary Least Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares) (OLS) in 1809 and fundamentally shaped the future of science, business, and society as we know it.\n\nSo, what is OLS and why is it so important?\n\nOLS is often referred to by many things across several different discipilines, some of them are:\n\n- Linear Regression\n- Multivariate Regression\n- The Normal Equations\n- Maximum Likelihood\n- Method of Moments\n- Singular Value Decomposition of $\\bf{X}\\bf{w}-\\bf{y}=U(\\Sigma'\\bf{w}-U'-\\bf{y})$\n\nBut all of them ultimately reflect the same mathematical expression (in scalar notation):\n\n$$y_i = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\beta_i x_i + \\epsilon_i$$\n\nWhich yields the famous estimator (i.e., equation) for $\\hat{\\beta_j}$ as\n\n$$\\hat{\\beta_j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2 / \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$$\n\nOr in matrix notation:\n\n$$\\bf \\hat{\\beta} = \\bf (X'X)^{-1} X'Y$$.\n\nI find this simple equation to be so extraordinary.\n\nWhy? Because of what can be learned from it: the equation basically says \"Look at data about $\\bf{x}$ and estimate a linear relationship to $\\bf{y}$\". \n\nAs a concrete example, imagine you wanted to know the relationship between age and income (a simplification of the well-studied [Mincer Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincer_earnings_function)), how would you figure this out? A simple linear regression could estimate that relationship and the $\\hat{\\beta}$ would represent the partial-correlation (sometimes called the marginal effect or coefficient estimate) and it exactly represents the slope of the line below.\n\n![A scatter plot!](scatterplot.png)\n\u003cp align=\"center\" style=\"padding:0\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eA Scatter Plot of Age and Income\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nIsn't that just amazing??\n\nThis single expression is used to estimate models for movie recommendations, businesses, pharmaceuticals, and even decisions about public health. I am constantly amazed at how one little equation could accomplish so much.\n\nTo think Gauss had discovered OLS as a method of calculating the orbits of celestial bodies and that today, over 200 years later, humans would use it to for so much of what we do is astounding.\n\nOver the years statisticians, economists, computer scientists, engineers, and psychometricians have advanced OLS in such profound and unique ways. Some of them have been used to reflect data generated from more non-standard distributions (e.g., a [Weibull distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution)), or to frame the problem to use prior information in a structured way (e.g., through [Bayesian Inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference)), while others have enhanced these equations to learn high-dimensional non-linear relationships (e.g., via [Artificial Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)). Again, all of these are extended from the extraordinary work of Gauss.\n\nThere's so much that can be written about all of the advancements that have been made in all of these fields and a short blog post simply won't do it justice, but I thought I'd at least share some thoughts about it.\n\nSomewhere along the way today I came across something related to important equations and it led me to write this, so I hope you enjoyed it. \n\nI'm such a fan of the history of statistics and mathematics that this piece, while not as structured as I'd like, was very enjoyable to write.\n\nHappy computing!\n\n-Francisco"},{"slug":"2021-goals","frontmatter":{"title":"Goals for 2021","description":"Sharing some of my goals for 2021","date":"January 9, 2021"},"excerpt":"","content":"\n[I previously wrote about 2020](https://franciscojavierarceo.github.io/post/learning-new-things) and I found that reflecting about the chaos of this past year was rather cathartic for me.\n\nWhile I feel lucky to have endured the pandemic without contracting COVID or suffering job losses, it has been quite isolating. I know that I'm not alone in feeling that and we're all getting through this in our own ways. Regardless, I found that writing my thoughts out loud was helpful, so I suppose I'll continue writing for now.\n\nSince I'm going to try to write more I figured I'd share some of my goals for the new year; so, here are my foolish high-level goals in some unknown order:\n\n1. Be a better husband\n2. Talk less, listen more\n3. Cook more intentionally\n4. Speak more intentionally\n5. Help others more effectively\n6. Write at least 2x per month\n7. Exercise ~5x per week\n\nI hope I'm able to accomplish these. With the exclusion of the last two, these goals aren't particularly measurable (I'll probably find a way to measure them) but I hope to make a good effort. I hope to look back here and attempt to hold myself accountable. Maybe I'll provide an update in June, who knows.\n\nMore specific goals that I have that are much more technical in nature are:\n- Connecting Django Rest Framework (DRF) and React while handling data and localization complexities;\n- Deploying a React Native application to both app stores;\n- Putting in some more hours on Airflow / Cloud Composer;\n- Learning how to train my recommendation models on Kubernetes.\n\nThese will be interesting and I'm making progress on DRF and React but I still have quite a bit of work to do.\n\nHopefully this year will be better, I'm optimistic about it."},{"slug":"i-love-code","frontmatter":{"title":"I Love Code","description":"Some thoughts on the elegance of code.","date":"January 6, 2021"},"excerpt":"","content":"\nI love code. Plain and simple.\n\nI didn't always though. I started programming at 21 years old during my first masters—I was studying statistics and used code only as a means for running regression models and doing microeconometrics research. I started statistical programming back in 2011 using [STATA](https://www.stata.com/) and [SAS](https://www.sas.com/). They weren't *real* programming languages by a computer scientist's standards but that is technically how I started.\n\nI eventually moved onto to learning [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) when I started working and I found myself often writing Monte Carlo simulations of harmonic regressions, two stage least-squares, and other machine learning/statistical phenomenon.\n\nAnd that's how it started. I began learning [Python](https://www.python.org/) more actively at work and it mostly increased from there. During my second masters I started learning [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) in order to use [Torch](http://torch.ch/), which was used by [facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) before [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) was developed. Then at Goldman I had to learn proprietary tools like Slang. Now I've spent the last year learning much more about [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) and web development in general, and I just couldn't help but reflect and think about how much I actually *enjoy* it.\n\nIt's 2021 now and it's officially beeen a 10 year journey learning how to code (although what can only be argued as chaotically and poorly across different disciplines). Back when I first started I had no idea how anything in a computer worked and I was really, really bad at it. \n\nIt was miserable and I always felt deeply insecure about my code. I feel lucky now that I'm no longer code-shy and I don't struggle as much as I used to. That's not to say I don't have typos or bugs (I do!) but it's more to say that it's much easier these days for me to read through and understand how things are working and how to debug.\n\nBut that took me 10 years and it was a literal headache for most of the time. I'm curious to see what I'll feel in 10 years and what else I'll have learned.\n\nAll that just to show this beautiful piece of code, which is *a* way to write a function which takes as input *n* and yields its [Fibonacci Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).\n\n```python\ndef f(n: int) -\u003e int:\n    assert n\u003e0, 'n \u003e 0'\n    if n \u003c 3:\n        return {1:0, 2:1}[n]\n    return f(n-1) + f(n-2)\n```\n\nWhich simply encodes $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \\forall n \u003e 1$, where $F_1 = F_2 = 1$.\n\nThis code is both brief *and* elegant. That's what I love about it. In 5 little lines so much of human collaboration and information is represented. To think that 5 little lines could do all of that is astounding to me, I genuinely find it beauitful. I guess that's because I just love code."},{"slug":"github-actions","frontmatter":{"title":"Deploying a Next.js Site using Github Actions","description":"GitHub Actions to Deploy a Static Site built with Next.js","date":"January 3, 2021"},"excerpt":"","content":"\nI'm a huge fan of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). They're so simple but so effective at doing such a broad range of things. In short, you can tell GitHub do something on a computer everytime you push to your repository (or to a branch on a specific repository like the `main` branch).\n\nFor today's post, I'll focus on how I used an action to automate deploying my static site built with Next.js to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).\n\nI made this blog on a repository hosted on GitHub and added a GitHub Action to compile the JavaScript/React code into static HTML files. This really didn't require all that much effort.\n\n\nHere's what I had to do:\n\n1. Build a Next.js blog following the [detailed tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) and store the code on a GitHub repository\n2. Create a workflow file in the repository with the following path: [**./github/workflows/integrate.yml**](https://github.com/franciscojavierarceo/franciscojavierarceo.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/integrate.yml)\n3. Specify that workflow file to export the static files whenever I push to **main** and *commit* the exported files to a separate branch called **gh-pages** (you can just follow the workflow file I used)\n4. Manually add a **.nojekyll** file to the **gh-pages** branch (this is to resolve [this bug](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/2029))\n5. Configure my repository Settings so that it sources the GitHub Pages build from the **gh-pages** branch\n\nAnd that's it, adding new blog posts is as simple as creating a new [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) file and pushing to the **main** branch. The GitHub Action will handle all of the rest!\n\nThis is much nicer in behavior than my old site, which was built using Jekyll (a Ruby framework) and it's much less work than building a full application with Django to get high quality page loads.

Fortunately, along the way I was able to learn some new things. More specifically, I spent a lot of my time learning how to develop web applications (particularly in \u003ca href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\"\u003eDjango\u003c/a\u003e), which included:\n\n- Building a Content Management System (\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\"\u003eCMS\u003c/a\u003e)\n- Image optimization and various forms of cacheing\n- User authentication and security best practices (e.g., two factor authentication)\n- Developing APIs using Django Rest Framework\n- The benefits of JavaScript code compression/minification\n- How to adhere to SEO best practices for web content\n- Building Webhooks for 3rd party APIs\n- Building an application that handles multiple languages in a database, as an API, and that optimizes for SEO\n\nIt has been an interesting exercise to be much more hands on with JavaScript this past year, especially since my expertise is mainly in Python. As a data scientist, it's interesting to learn how the web is developed and how data is created from the web.\n\nIn statistics, the Data Generating Process (\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_generating_process\"\u003eDGP\u003c/a\u003e) is an extremely critical part of approximating the world with mathematical functions.
