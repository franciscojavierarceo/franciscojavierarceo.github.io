# The Irrationality of Humans

I find human behavior and decision making wildly fascinating...and mostly comical,
especially my own. This is because of the variety of paradoxes, cognitive biases,
and irrationalities that are constantly at play in our micro and macro conclusions.

In fact, these irrational behaviors are largely what led me into the career I have today.
It all started with *economics and statistics* (my first graduate degree/love)
and I've spent ten years working in understanding human behavior. Maybe the methods
and engineering are fancier now than ten years ago but, at my core, I am still
fascinated by human behavior, data, and statistical inference--the methods that
provide a small understanding about people's interesting choices.

And what I've found in that time is that humans are just kind of ***weird*** in their
behaviors and decision making. Some would say down right irrational...I certainly
would.

Much of this irrationality comes from all sorts of paradoxes and cognitive biases
that are well known in different academic disciplines but that aren't as well known
by most folks. So I thought I'd write briefly about them and why they're important.

It's worth noting that even if you are aware of these things, you are still quite
likely to be subject to them or make the mistakes they call out---I do all the
time. Regardless, knowing them can help you mitigate them (to some degree) and
help you make better decisions (though I should note my own decision making is
nothing to be brag about but I decided to write this because I thought it'd be
fun).

# Paradoxes and Biases

I have decided to explicitly order these in the order I felt is the most
important. This, too, is likely ridden with bias but I find that this is the
order that is most important to me and that I've found the most useful in my
personal and professional life.

## 00. The Double Standard

This is probably my favorite bias because people (like me, for example) commit
this often and it's such a subtle but common thing.

Definitionally, a Double Standard is "the application of different sets of principles
for situations that are, in principle, the same."

I find this to be very important professionally as people often have unrealistic
expectations of others that they wouldn't have of themselves. I find this
comes up when folks without domain expertise are frustrated by timelines of
for bujilding various things.

More simply put, *"Why does this take so long?"*

As a manager, I often ask myself "If I were doing this, would I expect the same
outcome in the same time?" and I find that this helps me better empathize and
be more realistic about the outcomes.

More importantly, my colleague will probably find me more tolerable. :)

## 01. The Curse of Knowledge

I say this non-ironically: something is obvious when you know it, and not
if you don't--so too the definition of [the Curse of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge).

This is something I experienced a lot in my career because people often forget
all of the context they have when referencing something. Business is very
jargon-y so when I onboard people or explain things I very explicitly try to
avoid using acronyms or cryptic language. It certainly takes mental effort but
it makes it much less frustrating for the other party.

Also, I find that assuming someone knows something or being surprised that
someone *doesn't* know something can sound extremely condescending, so probably
best to avoid that.

## 02. Simpson's Paradox

I could write an entire post about [Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox)
but, to keep it brief, Simpson's Paradox is a statistical phenomenon in which a
correlation between two variables can be reversed by the addition of another.

But how???

![Simpson's Paradox: Negative Correlation](simpsons_paradox_1.png)

Above variables $X$ and $Y$ are negatively correlated, quite strongly too with
a correlation coefficient of -0.74. But what if there was some known group
variable $Z$ which represented 5 groups and we could see:

![Simpson's Paradox: Positive Correlation](simpsons_paradox_2.png)

While this is useful for regression analysis and statistical inference, I find
this paradox to be applicable to many more situations. Simply, I may *always* be
missing a single, critical piece of information that may flip my conclusion. So
I tend to calibrate my opinions accordingly.

## 03. The Sunk Cost Fallacy

As elegantly written by [The Decision Lab](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-sunk-cost-fallacy),
"The Sunk Cost Fallacy describes our tendency to follow through on an endeavor
if we have already invested time, effort, or money into it, whether or not the
current costs outweigh the benefits."

Emotion often clutters our ability to understand the *actual* expected
reward/value of a given thing we are putting effort into but sometimes it is
in our best interest to cut our losses rather than see it through.

## 05. Loss Aversion

Loss aversion is simply the irrational and typically disproportional weight a
person places on minimizing losses to acquire econcomic gains.

For example, someone would prefer to take $10 with 100% certainty rather than
$20 with 90% certainty because the displeasure from that 10% possibility
outweighs the pleasure they'd receive from the additional $10 (or expected $8 = 0.9 * 20).

This is not rational and puts non-disciplined investors at a mathematical
disadvantage.

## 06. The Gambler's Fallacy

The Gambler's Fallcy refers to the incorrect belief that a given event is more
or less likely given a previous sequence of events.

This can be seen through coin flips. If you see 5 heads flipped in a row, you
may think that a tails is "due" but this is incorrect (assuming a fair coin) since
coin flips are always independent (i.e., one flip doesn't depend on the next).

## 07. Anchoring

Pulling again from [The Decision Lab](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/anchoring-bias),
"Anchoring is a cognitive bias that causes us to rely too heavily on the first
piece of information we are given about a topic. When we are setting plans or
making estimates about something, we interpret newer information from the
reference point of our anchor, instead of seeing it objectively."

This is often used in marketing and pricing to delude you into thinking
something is on sale. :')

## 08. Decision Fatigue
## 09. Optimism Bias
## 10. Response Bias
## 11. Sample Bias
## 12. Assignment Bias
## 13. Self-Selection Bias
## 14. The Accuracy Paradox
## 15. The Dunning-Kruger Effect
