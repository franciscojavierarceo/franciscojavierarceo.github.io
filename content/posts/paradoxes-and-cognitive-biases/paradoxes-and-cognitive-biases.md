# The Irrationality of Humans

I find human behavior and decision making wildly fascinating...and mostly comical,
especially my own. This is because of the variety of paradoxes, cognitive biases,
and irrationalities that are constantly at play in our micro and macro conclusions.

In fact, these irrational behaviors are largely what led me into the career I have today.
It all started with *economics and statistics* (my first graduate degree/love)
and I've spent ten years working in understanding human behavior. Maybe the methods
and engineering are fancier now than ten years ago but, at my core, I am still
fascinated by human behavior, data, and statistical inference--the methods that
provide a small understanding about people's interesting choices.

And what I've found in that time is that humans are just kind of ***weird*** in their
behaviors and decision making. Some would say down right irrational...I certainly
would.

Much of this irrationality comes from all sorts of paradoxes and cognitive biases
that are well known in different academic disciplines but that aren't as well known
by most folks. So I thought I'd write briefly about them and why they're important.

It's worth noting that even if you are aware of these things, you are still quite
likely to be subject to them or make the mistakes they call out---I do all the
time. Regardless, knowing them can help you mitigate them (to some degree) and
help you make better decisions (though I should note my own decision making is
nothing to be brag about but I decided to write this because I thought it'd be
fun).

# Paradoxes and Biases

I have decided to explicitly order these in the order I felt is the most important.
This, too, is likely ridden with bias but I find that this is the order that is
most important to me and that I've found the most useful in my life.

## 01. The Curse of Knowledge


## 02. Simpson's Paradox
## 03. The Sunk Cost Falacy
## 04. Bandwagon Effect
## 05. Loss Aversion
## 06. The Gambler's Fallacy
## 07. Anchoring
## 08. Decision Fatigue
## 09. Optimism Bias
## 10. Response Bias
## 11. Sample Bias
## 12. Assignment Bias
## 13. Self-Selection Bias
## 14. Accuracy Paradox
