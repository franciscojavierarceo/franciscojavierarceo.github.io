# The Irrationality of Humans

I find human behavior and decision making wildly fascinating...and mostly comical,
especially my own. This is because of the variety of paradoxes, cognitive biases,
and irrationalities that are constantly at play in our micro and macro conclusions.

In fact, these irrational behaviors are largely what led me into the career I have today.
It all started with *economics and statistics* (my first graduate degree/love)
and I've spent ten years working in understanding human behavior. Maybe the methods
and engineering are fancier now than ten years ago but, at my core, I am still
fascinated by human behavior, data, and statistical inference--the methods that
provide a small understanding about people's interesting choices.

And what I've found in that time is that humans are just kind of ***weird*** in their
behaviors and decision making. Some would say down right irrational...I certainly
would.

Much of this irrationality comes from all sorts of paradoxes and cognitive biases
that are well known in different academic disciplines (particularly behavioral
economics and statistics) but that aren't as well known by most folks. So I
thought I'd write briefly about them and why they're important.

It's worth emphasizing that even if you are aware of these things, you are still quite
likely to be subject to them or make the mistakes they call out---I do all the
time. Regardless, knowing them can help you mitigate them (to some degree) and
help you make better decisions (though I should note my own decision making is
nothing to be brag about but I decided to write this because I thought it'd be
fun).

# Paradoxes and Biases

I have decided to explicitly order these in the order I felt is the most
important. This, too, is likely ridden with bias but I find that this is the
order that is most important to me and that I've found the most useful in my
personal and professional life.

## 00. The Dunning-Kruger Effect

[The Dunning-Kruger Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
is one of the most important cognitive biases that exist, probably because how
impactful it is to everyone else.

In short, people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability and those
with high ability tend to underestimate them.

If you pay attention, you will see this occurrence often especially from people
without much experience in a given area of expertise (though not always true).

You may also see this from senior executives at big corporations.

## 01. The Double Standard

This is probably my favorite bias because people (like me, for example) commit
this often and it's such a subtle but common thing. In my opinion, this bias
tends to be a consequence of the Dunning-Kruger Efect mentioned before.

Definitionally, a Double Standard is "the application of different sets of
principles for situations that are, in principle, the same."

I find this to be very important professionally as people often have unrealistic
expectations of others that they wouldn't have of themselves. I find this
comes up when folks without domain expertise are frustrated by timelines of
for bujilding various things.

More simply put, *"Why does this take so long?"*

As a manager, I often ask myself "If I were doing this, would I expect the same
outcome in the same time?" and I find that this helps me better empathize and
be more realistic about the outcomes.

More importantly, my colleague will probably find me more tolerable. :)

## 02. The Curse of Knowledge

I say this non-ironically: something is obvious when you know it, and not
if you don't--so too the definition of [the Curse of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge).

This is something I experienced a lot in my career because people often forget
all of the context they have when referencing something. Business is very
jargon-y so when I onboard people or explain things I very explicitly try to
avoid using acronyms or cryptic language. It certainly takes mental effort but
it makes it much less frustrating for the other party.

Also, I find that assuming someone knows something or being surprised that
someone *doesn't* know something can sound extremely condescending, so probably
best to avoid that.

## 03. Simpson's Paradox

I could write an entire post about [Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox)
but, to keep it brief, Simpson's Paradox is a statistical phenomenon in which a
correlation between two variables can be reversed by the addition of another.

But how???

![Simpson's Paradox: Negative Correlation](simpsons_paradox_1.png)

Above variables $X$ and $Y$ are negatively correlated, quite strongly too with
a correlation coefficient of -0.74. But what if there was some known group
variable $Z$ which represented 5 groups and we could see:

![Simpson's Paradox: Positive Correlation](simpsons_paradox_2.png)

While this is useful for regression analysis and statistical inference, I find
this paradox to be applicable to many more situations. Simply, I may *always* be
missing a single, critical piece of information that may flip my conclusion. So
I tend to calibrate my opinions accordingly.

## 04. The Sunk Cost Fallacy

As elegantly written by [The Decision Lab](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-sunk-cost-fallacy),
"The Sunk Cost Fallacy describes our tendency to follow through on an endeavor
if we have already invested time, effort, or money into it, whether or not the
current costs outweigh the benefits."

Emotion often clutters our ability to understand the *actual* expected
reward/value of a given thing we are putting effort into but sometimes it is
in our best interest to cut our losses rather than see it through.

## 06. Loss Aversion

Loss aversion is simply the irrational and typically disproportional weight a
person places on minimizing losses to acquire econcomic gains.

For example, someone would prefer to take $10 with 100% certainty rather than
$20 with 90% certainty because the displeasure from that 10% possibility
outweighs the pleasure they'd receive from the additional $10 (or expected $8 = 0.9 * 20).

This is not rational and puts non-disciplined investors at a mathematical
disadvantage.

## 07. The Gambler's Fallacy

The Gambler's Fallcy refers to the incorrect belief that a given event is more
or less likely given a previous sequence of events.

This can be seen through coin flips. If you see 5 heads flipped in a row, you
may think that a tails is "due" but this is incorrect (assuming a fair coin) since
coin flips are always independent (i.e., one flip doesn't depend on the next).

## 08. Anchoring

Pulling again from [The Decision Lab](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/anchoring-bias),
"Anchoring is a cognitive bias that causes us to rely too heavily on the first
piece of information we are given about a topic. When we are setting plans or
making estimates about something, we interpret newer information from the
reference point of our anchor, instead of seeing it objectively."

This is often used in marketing and pricing to delude you into thinking
something is on sale. :')

## 09. Sample/Selection Bias

Sample bias originates from statistics and is a result of a flawed collection
of an intended random sample.

This is particularly common in business and twitter where people think their
customers or twitter poll-responders are representative of the entire
population. They're not and this can often lead to very poor decision making.

## 10. Assignment Bias

[Assignment Bias](https://www.statisticshowto.com/assignment-bias/#:~:text=Assignment%20bias%20happens%20when%20experimental,people%20who%20are%20significantly%20smarter.)
is similar to Sample Bias in that it is a bias in the sample
but is rooted in a broken assignment system. For example, imagine an
expermiental drug trial where the "random assignment machine" only treated the
young health, while both pathological and extreme it highlights the issue.

By the way, it turns out that a good "random" sample is extremely hard to
collect in the real world--ask the Census.

## 11. Self-Selection Bias

[Self-Selection Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-selection_bias)
is another form of sample bias but it's caused by the participants choosing
whether or not to participate in the experiment or treatment.

Again, in the example above imagine that instead that "random assignment
machine" instead only treated the people who wanted to be treated and not the
ones that did.

Similar to the previous case it would ruin the experiment.

## 12. Decision Fatigue

[Decision Fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue) is a
phenomenon whereby an individual's decision making quality deteriorates after a
long session of decision making.

In short, you get tired of making choices and you start to get sloppy. In the
business and investing world, this is extremely consequential.

## 13. Optimism Bias

To quote Wikipedia, "[Optimism Bias[(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias)
is a cognitive bias that causes someone to believe that they themselves are less
likely to experience a negative event. It is also known as unrealistic optimism
or comparative optimism."

It is good to be optimistic but it is *good-er* to balance it in reality.

## 14. Response Bias

[Response Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_bias) is both interesting
and counterintuitive.

It is catch-all for the frequent tendency of participants to respond
inaccurately or falsely to survey questions. This is part of the reason surveys
often conflict with reality.

As a statistician, I feel surverys are *kind of* useful but behaviors reveal the
truth. Measure behaviors.

For internet companies, you'll often find that survery metrics from users often
conflict with tracking metrics that you have for your customer. What we say and
what we do are often different.

## 15. The Accuracy Paradox

Lastly, [The Accuracy Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_paradox)
is the paradoxical finding that Accuracy isn't necessarily a good metric for for
measuring statistical or machine learning models.

This is because of an imbalance of outcomes.

Suppose I was trying to predict a whether someone had a rare illness (1
out of 10,000 people have it), if I predicted everyone didn't have it I'd still
have 99.99% accuracy.

So, it can often be quite useless to use accuracy as a metric for assessing the
quality of things (though not always).

# Managing Irrational Decision Making

In short, you probably can't completely stop yourself from irrational decision
making but you can manage it.

I try do this by acknowleding the biases above and the idiosyncratic ones
I have from existing. I find that I often change my mind after some reflection.

Some find this annoying but I think that my early reaction or understanding is
often not the optimal one so I try to spend time reflecting on my decisions so
that I can make better informed ones.

I write things down rather frequently (typically with pen and paper, the good ol'
fashion way). I find this also helps me to more accurately critique things and
brings me mental clarity.
