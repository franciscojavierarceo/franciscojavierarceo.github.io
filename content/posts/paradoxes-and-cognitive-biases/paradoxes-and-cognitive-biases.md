title: Paradoxes and Cognitive Biases
description: A brief review of some of my favorite paradoxes and cognitive biases

I find human behavior and decision making wildly fascinating...and mostly comical,
especially my own. This is because of the variety of paradoxes and cognitive biases
that are constantly at play in our micro and macro conclusions and decisions.

In fact, these irrational behaviors are largely what led me into the career I have today.
It all started with economics and statistics and I've spent ten years working in
understanding human behavior. Maybe the methods and engineering are fancier now than
ten years ago but, at my core, I am still fascinated by data, statistical inference,
and human behavior.

And what I've found in that time is that humans are just kind of *weird* in their
behaviors and decision making. Some would say down right irrational, I would.

Much of this irrationality comes from all sorts of paradoxes and cognitive biases
that are well known in different academic disciplines but that aren't as well known
by most folks. So I thought I'd write briefly about them and why they're important.

It's worth noting that even if you are aware of  these things, you are still quite
likely to be subject to them or make the mistake---I do all the time. Regardless,
knowing them can help you mitigate them (to some degree) and help you make better
decisions (though I should note my own decision making is nothing to be brag
about but oh well).
