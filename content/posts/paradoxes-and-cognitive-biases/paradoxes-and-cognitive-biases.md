# The Irrationality of Humans

I find human behavior and decision making wildly fascinating...and mostly comical,
especially my own. This is because of the variety of paradoxes, cognitive biases,
and irrationalities that are constantly at play in our micro and macro conclusions.

In fact, these irrational behaviors are largely what led me into the career I have today.
It all started with *economics and statistics* (my first graduate degree/love)
and I've spent ten years working in understanding human behavior. Maybe the methods
and engineering are fancier now than back then but, at my core, I am still
fascinated by human behavior, data, and statistical inference—the methods that
provide a glimpse of understanding about a person's choices.

What I've found is that humans are just kind of ***weird*** in their
behaviors and decision making. Some would say down right irrational...I certainly
would.

Much of that irrationality comes from all sorts of paradoxes and cognitive
biases that are well known in different academic disciplines (particularly
behavioral economics and statistics) but that aren't as well known by most
folks. So I thought I'd write briefly about them and why they're important.

It's worth emphasizing that even if you are aware of these things, you are still quite
likely to be subject to them or make the mistakes they call out—***I do all of the
time***. Regardless, knowing them can—to some degree—help you mitigate them
and help you make better decisions.

I would like to over-emphasize that my own decision making is nothing to brag
about but I decided to write this because I thought it'd be fun and I do love
behavioral economics and statistics.

# Paradoxes and Biases

I have decided to explicitly order these in the order I felt is the most
important. This, too, is ridden with bias but I believe that this is the
order most important to me and that I've found the most useful in my
personal and professional life.

## 00. The Dunning-Kruger Effect

[The Dunning-Kruger Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
is one of the most important cognitive biases that exist, probably because how
impactful it is to everyone (i.e., we all suffer from the burden of incompetent
people and it is quite likely we, too, are someone's burden).

In short, people with low ability at a given task tend to overestimate their
ability and those with high ability tend to underestimate it.

If you pay attention, you will see this occurrence often...especially from
those without much experience in a given area of expertise (though this is not
always true).

You may see this often from people in business..run away.

## 01. The Double Standard

This is probably my favorite bias because people (like me, for example) commit
this often and it's such a subtle yet common thing. I believe this bias to be a
consequence of the Dunning-Kruger Efect mentioned above.

Definitionally, a Double Standard is "the application of different sets of
principles for situations that are, in principle, the same."

I find this to be very important professionally as people often have unrealistic
expectations of others that they wouldn't have of themselves. I find this
comes up when folks without domain expertise are frustrated by timelines of
for bujilding various things.

Said another way, *"Why does this take so long?"*

As a manager, I regularly ask myself "If I were doing this, would I expect the
same outcome in the same time?" and I find that this helps me better empathize
and be more realistic about the outcomes.

More importantly, my colleagues probably find me more tolerable. :)

## 02. The Curse of Knowledge

I say this non-ironically: something is obvious when you know it, and not
if you don't--so too the definition of [the Curse of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge).

This is something I experienced a lot in my career because people often forget
all of the context they have when referencing something. Business is very
jargony so when I onboard people or explain things I very explicitly try to
avoid using acronyms or cryptic language. It certainly takes mental effort but
it makes it much less frustrating for the other party.

Also, I find that assuming someone knows something or being surprised that
someone *doesn't* know something can sound extremely condescending, so probably
best to avoid that.

## 03. Simpson's Paradox

I could write an entire post about [Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox)
but, to keep it brief, Simpson's Paradox is a statistical phenomenon in which a
correlation between two variables can be reversed by the addition of another.

But how??? Time for a graph!

![Simpson's Paradox: Negative Correlation](simpsons_paradox_1.png)

Above variables $X$ and $Y$ are negatively correlated, quite strongly too with
a correlation coefficient of -0.74. But what if there was some known group
variable $Z$ which represented 5 groups, we would then be able to see:

![Simpson's Paradox: Positive Correlation](simpsons_paradox_2.png)

While this is useful for regression analysis and statistical inference, I find
this paradox to be applicable to many more situations.

Simply, I may *always* be missing a single, critical piece of information that
may flip my conclusion. So I tend to calibrate my opinions accordingly.

## 04. The Sunk Cost Fallacy

As elegantly written by [The Decision Lab](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-sunk-cost-fallacy),
"The Sunk Cost Fallacy describes our tendency to follow through on an endeavor
if we have already invested time, effort, or money into it, whether or not the
current costs outweigh the benefits."

Emotion often clutters our ability to understand the *actual* expected
reward/value of a given thing we are putting effort into but sometimes it is
in our best interest to cut our losses rather than see it through.

It rarely feels good but can often be the optimal decision.

## 06. Loss Aversion

Loss aversion is simply the irrational and typically disproportional weight a
person places on minimizing losses to acquire econcomic gains.

For example, someone would prefer to take \$10 with 100% certainty rather than
\$20 with 90% certainty because the displeasure from that 10\% possibility
outweighs the pleasure they'd receive from the additional \$10 (or expected \$8 = (0.9 * 20) - 10).

This is not rational and puts non-disciplined investors at a mathematical
disadvantage.

## 07. The Gambler's Fallacy

The [Gambler's Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy)
refers to the incorrect belief that a given event is more
or less likely given a previous sequence of events when the event is not a
function of time.

This can be seen through coin flips. If you see 5 heads flipped in a row, you
may think that a tails is "due" but this is incorrect (assuming a fair coin) since
coin flips are always independent (i.e., one flip doesn't depend on the next).

## 08. Anchoring

Pulling again from [the Decision Lab](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/anchoring-bias),
"Anchoring is a cognitive bias that causes us to rely too heavily on the first
piece of information we are given about a topic. When we are setting plans or
making estimates about something, we interpret newer information from the
reference point of our anchor, instead of seeing it objectively."

This is often used in marketing and pricing to delude you into thinking
something is on sale. :')

## 09. Sample Bias

Sample bias originates from statistics and is a result of a flawed collection
of an intended random sample.

This is particularly common in business and Twitter where people think their
customers or Twitter poll-responders are representative of the entire
population.

They're not and this can often lead to very poor decision making or conclusions.

## 10. Assignment Bias

[Assignment Bias](https://www.statisticshowto.com/assignment-bias/#:~:text=Assignment%20bias%20happens%20when%20experimental,people%20who%20are%20significantly%20smarter.)
is similar to Sample Bias in that it is a bias in the sample
but is rooted in a broken assignment system. For example, imagine an
experimental drug trial where the "random assignment machine" (i.e., a machine
that assigns things at random) only treated the young and healthy,
while that is a pathological and extreme example it highlights the issue.

By the way, it turns out that a good "random" sample is extremely hard to
collect in the real world—ask the Census.

## 11. Self-Selection Bias

[Self-Selection Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-selection_bias)
is another form of sample bias but it's caused by the participants choosing
whether or not to participate in the experiment or treatment.

Again, in the example above imagine instead that the "random assignment
machine" only treated the people who wanted to be treated and not the
ones that did.

Similar to the previous case it would ruin the experiment.

## 12. Decision Fatigue

[Decision Fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue) is a
phenomenon whereby an individual's decision making quality deteriorates after a
long session of decision making.

In short, you get tired of making choices and you start to get sloppy. In the
business and investing world, this is extremely consequential because your or
your investor's money is on the line.

## 13. Optimism Bias

To quote Wikipedia, "[Optimism Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias)
is a cognitive bias that causes someone to believe that they themselves are less
likely to experience a negative event. It is also known as unrealistic optimism
or comparative optimism."

It is good to be optimistic but it is *good-er* to balance it in reality.

## 14. Response Bias

[Response Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_bias) is both interesting
and counterintuitive.

It is catch-all for the frequent tendency of participants to respond
inaccurately or falsely to survey questions. This is part of the reason surveys
often conflict with reality.

As a statistician, I feel surverys are *kind of* useful but behaviors reveal the
truth. Measure behaviors.

For internet companies, you may find that user-survery metrics conflict with
tracking metrics that you have for your customer. What people say and what they
do are often wildly different.

## 15. The Accuracy Paradox

Lastly, [The Accuracy Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_paradox)
is the paradoxical finding that Accuracy isn't necessarily a good metric for for
measuring statistical or machine learning models.

This is because of an imbalance of outcomes.

Suppose I was trying to predict a whether someone had a rare illness (1
out of 10,000 people have it), if I predicted everyone didn't have it I'd still
have 99.99% accuracy.

So, accuracy can often be quite useless as a metric for assessing the
quality of things in general (though not always).

# Managing the Irrational

You *probably* can't completely stop yourself from irrational decision making
but you can *possibly* manage it.

My approach is simple: acknowledge the biases above, the idiosyncratic ones I have
from my life exeriences, and reflect frequently. I find that this results in me
changing my mind often.

This can be frustrating but I think that early reactions or understandings
are often not the optimal ones so I try to put effort into reflecting so that I
can just do better.

# Some Advice

(this advice may or may not be useful)

Being objective is nearly impossible when it relates to human judgement, and I'm
not even exactly sure what "objective" *really* means outside of mathematics.

But my advice on being as objective as possible is to write things down:
bullet points, a simple pros and cons list, or whatever suits you can highlight
flaws in your judgement and reasoning.

I find this brings me mental clarity more than anything else really. I also
tend to write things down on paper the good ol' fashion way (maybe it's an
old habit grounded in problem sets, who knows).

Managing cognitive biases and mitigating the adverse consequences they may hold
is extremely challenging but a well worthy endeavor, as good decisions compound
like great investments.

But don't worry too much if you find yourself struggling with it, we are all
human after all.
