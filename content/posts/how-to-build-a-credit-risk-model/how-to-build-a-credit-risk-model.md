I previously [wrote](/post/data-science-and-fintech) about some of the work data scientists do in the fintech space, which briefly discussed [credit risk models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_risk) but I only briefed touched on the topic and I wanted to do a more technical deep dive and talk about some of the main points.

I worked at a couple of banks before as a data scientist and built credit risk models in both the consumer and commercial space, in both the US and Australia and I learned a lot from those experiences and so I thought I'd share a simplification of how a core part of underwriting is done.

## What is a Credit Risk Model?

## Data and the Definition of Default

## Estimating the Probability of Default

## Evaluating your Default Model
- AUC and GINI

## Common Mistakes and Pitfalls
- Simpson's Paradox

## Other Important pieces
- Panel Data and the Discrete-Time Hazard Model

## Conclusion
