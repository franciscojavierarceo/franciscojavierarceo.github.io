It has been quite an extraordinary year and it has gone by terribly quickly, but I suppose that's a natural part of the aging process.

So far this year has gone completely differently than I had originally planned but I am grateful for it, it has been quite fun.

Reflecting briefly at my goals, which as I listed in my previous blog post were:

1. Be a better husband
2. Talk less, listen more
3. Cook more intentionally
4. Speak more intentionally
5. Help others more effectively
6. Write at least 2x per month
7. Exercise ~5x per week


I tried to improve on all of these items over the past year (some significantly more than others), but I'm not where I wanted to be on them.

Regardless, I will say I learned a lot more this year by explicitly trying to improve these things. The goals I found most challengine were (1), (2), (5), and (6). I imagine this is because (1) is hard in general, (2) requires constant mental restraint from speaking up when I want to interject with a response or a thought, (5) doesn't truly realize its effectiveness in short time horizons, and (6) was just not prioritizing it. 

I'm mostly okay with the realities of this except (6), since it requires being more intentional about my time and thoughts, which disappoints me as it suggests I was less intentional than I wanted to be. As I grow older I realize how much more important it is to be increasingly more deliberate with the allocation of my time but I always struggle with choosing things as I enjoy working on and learning a variety of different things.

Anyways, here's to hoping I'm more intentional with my time over the next couple of months and years.

Cheers,
Francisco
