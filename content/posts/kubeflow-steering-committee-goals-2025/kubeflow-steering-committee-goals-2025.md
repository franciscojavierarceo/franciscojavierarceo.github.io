# Kubeflow Goals

**Author:**[Francisco Javier Arceo](mailto:ArceoFrancisco@gmail.com) | **Date:**Nov 20, 2024

We are at a critical moment in time for AI/ML. Open-source models have taken center stage, and resilient, scalable infrastructure has become critical to the success of AI. However, infrastructure alone isn't enoughâ€”tools must inspire excitement and engagement among users.

As a Kubeflow Steering Committee member, my core focus would be to drive engagement and increase adoption by improving the experience and impact of Kubeflow for end users, ensuring it's not only a robust platform but also one that people love to use. More precisely, I would focus on 6 key goals.

1. **Expanding Kubeflow Adoption:** increasing awareness, adoption, and engagement through collaborations with enterprises and startups.  
2. **Making RAG a first class priority:** the AI community has settled on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) as a critical component for production AI. I will work to make this a new focus area for Kubeflow.  
3. **Improving the User/Developer Experience for Model Developers/Users:** simplifying workflows and enhancing usability to reduce barriers to entry.  
4. **Engaging and Empowering AI Engineers:** supporting software engineers integrating AI/ML into their products. By providing intuitive workflows, thoughtful defaults, and subsets of Kubeflow's tooling, we can ensure AI Engineers are set up for long-term success as they scale their products.  
5. **Building a more Feature-Complete AI/ML Platform:** driving development of critical features to support end-to-end AI/ML workflows.  
6. **Improving Documentation:** ensuring comprehensive, user-friendly docs and resources for the community.  
7. **Strengthening the Community:** fostering a vibrant, inclusive contributor and user ecosystem to support Kubeflow's long-term growth.

I believe [I am qualified](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franciscojavierarceo/) to help lead Kubeflow's [values and structure](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/KUBEFLOW-STEERING-COMMITTEE.md#kubeflow-steering-committee) because of my past open-source contributions and professional experience. 

As a [leader](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DgtDmLCBnXQF9qva9X6Vac2ehpplj2iz6ZYw76NL8gM/edit?tab=t.0), [maintainer](https://feast.dev/blog/the-future-of-feast/), and [contributor](https://insights.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/foundation/lf-ai-foundation/overview/github?project=feast&repository=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffeast-dev%2Ffeast&routedFrom=Github&dateFilters=Last%2010%20Years&dateRange=2014-11-20%20to%202024-11-20&compare=PP&granularity=year&hideBots=true) to Feast, I have helped evolve a critical component of the MLOps ecosystem, driving innovation in feature storage and retrieval. My 12+ [years of experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franciscojavierarceo) at the intersection of data engineering, AI/ML engineering, and MLOps include technical and managerial leadership roles at Red Hat, Affirm, Fast, Goldman Sachs, and others. Across these positions, I've designed, built, and scaled AI **models and platforms** in production, gaining a deep understanding of user pain points and opportunities to innovate.

I bring this experience to Kubeflow with a vision of making it the leading open source platform for scalable, production-grade AI/ML. By expanding adoption, improving the user experience, and delivering a feature-complete solution, my goal is to empower MLOps teams to build a powerful AI/ML platform that enables their success and expands the global impact of AI.
