I've written about the wonders of [Linear Regression](https://franciscojavierarceo.github.io/post/ordinary-least-squares) before and one of the things I find most amazing about it is that it allows you to approximate a function.

But what does that mean?

Take two things with some relationship and estimate what that relationship looks like as a formula.

Suppose you were interested in the relationship between Age and Income; i.e., you wanted to understand how a person's age *correlates* to their income.

You could draw a scatter plot (like below) and look at the relationship between them and fit (i.e., estimate) the relationship (i.e., the slope of that line).
